Dutifully executing conventional activities yieldlessly. These are aspects of a bullshit job wherein one does work without knowing why or alternatively knowing that is futile in terms of generating an outcome that is to the benefit of the commons or creation (and therefore oneself - apart from a wage); these activities have no intrinsic benefit for humanity (i.e. enhance civilization's productivity) or the ecology. By definition such work does not have a yield and is extractive. Any activity (i.e. transaction) without yield is destructive and traumatic over the long run for one's sense of self. It is a decay because one does see the damage in the short run; it accumulates like rot.
