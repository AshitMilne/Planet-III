A layered conceptual model of identity including cryptographic (wallets, blockchain), semantic (domains, digital handles, semper idem), and human (personal, social) layers, used to anchor ethical and coordinated action in digital systems. Metaphorically this is Dial Square and its components: Stone Rose, Redcurrant and Yoga Element. Also known as semper idem (semantic perimeter of identity embodied) it is constituted of the solid set of existing transactions (Stone Rose), a distilled set of transactional behaviour generated consistently in clock time (Hourglass of Redcurrant);  an indication (or metric) of how productive those activities are (Yoga Element) provide *transition* insight - a path towards behaviour that aligns you self-interest with those of the commons and the ecology (leading you to discover your Calling).
