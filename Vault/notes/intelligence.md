A form of holistic and intentional agency characteristic of liveness which is systemically aware through constant receipt and distribution of signal concerning identity to its environment based on well-codified persistent protocols particular to the category of form taken. It operates objectively (truth) and in the natural state manifests aesthetic appeal (beauty) at least in the aggregate. As such it commands universal legitimacy. As a model *only* it may help think about intelligence as having two aspects of liveness - anima (the vital - nurturing and still) and animus (spirited and kinetic).
