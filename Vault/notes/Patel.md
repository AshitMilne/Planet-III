My surname at birth, **Patel**, constitutes a symbolic name for civilization. It evokes a mound — a `tel` (תֵּל) — built on the foundation of shared sustenance (`pat`, פַּת). Civilization is the manifestation of community coming together (मिलना), forming the structures needed to sustain life — a tel that has achieved `mishpat` (justice). In this sense, “so shall” becomes “Just is.”
