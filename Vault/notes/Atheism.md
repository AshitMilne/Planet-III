The refusal to admit a fundamental separation between a creator and Creation (Nature). Non-dualist traditions such as Taoism, Advaita Vedanta, and Buddhism operate within this frame, maintaining depth without recourse to a deity apart from the world. Pagan and animist systems, by contrast, may be read as entropic proliferations of deities arising from the tension between dualist and non-dualist worldviews.
