An alternative, more system-design-oriented term for _Deus En Machina_, describing what a decentralized network amounts to in practical terms. Its objectivity derives from scale: just as a large collection of serious estimates converges on a relatively accurate aggregate, outliers become materially insignificant (thin tails). The system—a virtual machine—is generative: it learns and gradually develops a coherent corpus of objective knowledge (epistemology). Over time, this produces an increasingly accurate model of reality and yields decisively useful measures of relative value within context.
