**Trinity Bellwoods Park (TBP)** is both a physical and conceptual framework. Physically, it is an ordinary urban green space in Toronto cherished for leisure, community gathering, and contemplative practice. Conceptually, TBP represents a practical, anarchist-inspired approach to personal and communal governance rooted in the trinity **“sustain, create, transform”** (Vishnu, Brahma, Shiva). It models incremental, positive change through self-governance, ecological (woods) attunement, and clarity of action (bell), emphasizing stillness, simplicity, and omission over additive intervention (park). TBP embodies a balance between structure, innovation, and evolution, reflecting both historical anarchist influence (Emma Goldman) and the cultivation of autonomous, principled community life. It is applied to the overarching trinity of your life - a structure constantly being innovated upon to evolve as you would like.
