Artwork: Vision represented by (a third) eye. Insight that ranges equivalence to express complexity however that trinity of architecture is framed across latitudes, and through time. Guided without instrumentation eternal Polaris (*Dhruv*) and the anima-borne tides of time, space and materiality are nonetheless sufficient for those with *arete* (virtue) to know up from down, wrong from right, truth from lie.



## Introduction  

>Can't you see a giant walks among you
>Seeing through your petty lives?
>Do you think I do these things for real?
>I do these things just so I survive
>~ I Spy (Pulp)

Here, I introduce the concept of **Giants** (entrenched power, coercive and hard power) and **Gods** (soft power as actualized by individuals developing and expressing virtue or arete).  Through a constant and deliberate practice they achieve *autonomy* from those self-styled giants and their *machina animus*. Autonomy is probably (at least for me) about as close to a freedom as is gets without the ultimate liberation (*moksha*) of the soul from body. Autonomy is the capacity to do as you require in order to live well and be free of another's influence - the ability to make you behave in ways that are *contrary* to your self-interest (often without you entirely being aware of it) and to their advantage at your cost. Your ability to understand clearly what self-interest amounts to is critical to your ability to sustain yourself in good health and to project that sustainability into the commons and into creation. Sustaining what you have with autonomy then gives you the opportunity to be creative *entirely on your own terms* - developing useful skills and attributes that allow you to appreciate and enjoy your life in the world *as you model it* and perhaps even be an agent for positive change. One is increasingly autonomous in order to sustain oneself; then one creates in order; ultimately one transforms oneself and the world.

Crucially however your autonomy is impinged upon by basic needs; for items such as food, clothing and shelter. Their price (but not their value to you) has always been out of your control. The one factor *within* your command is the opportunity to to save a surplus and be rewarded for it. A reward which compounds (at any rate) and which eventually affords autonomy.

This was undermined in 2008 when the United States added a nominal 1.2 Trillion dollars to restore liquidity after a bout of malinvestment by institutions and individuals alike. This *debasement* decisively undermined the dollar regime's credibility and legitimacy. Indeed protest rained heavily from the entire range of political opinion. In the aftermath, alternatives emerged that allowed capital (even its purest for as data) to flow securely and seamlessly at speed. These are now in the process of being adopted by the dollar regime and will in time restore credibility to its institutions.

Not even the Hegemon can resist this as the technology because it is *globally* distributed and offers *any* regime the opportunity to secure productive outcomes and contentment for its people. Several are seizing this opportunity with effort to demonetize their regimes (by removing paper cash) as well as introducing unassailable identity assurance. Others are arranging themselves around these new hubs - the most populous and demographically promising on earth.

The giants and their Leviathan are no longer be able to impinge upon the autonomy of a person (unless they themselves allow it) because they have lost the capacity to arbitrarily assign a price for money (the interest rate). There is cause of enormous optimism as this has profoundly positive implications for our planet and the preservation of its ecology. No threat is greater to the environment than inflation (masked as money debasement).

This a commentary on ancient mythology that has resonance today - of self-styled giants on the one hand and the notion of monism - or God: those who possess the divine within sufficiently and who sustain, create and transform truth into beauty in whatever station fate has them in the emerging global reality.



## ἀρετή

> Ἀλλὰ Ζεὺς ὁ πάντων ἀκουστὸς ἀνδρὶ ἀρετὴν ἥμισυ λαοῖσιν ἀφαιρεῖται, ἐπεὶ ἄρα δούλη ἔπειτα ἔλθῃ.
>
> For Zeus, who views the wide world, takes away half a man's *arete* on the day when slavery comes upon him.”
> — *The Odyssey*, Book 17, line 322

Virtue (a sense of ethics) is a key concept in human-centric architectures that aim to scale human interaction and cooperation to achieve meaningful positive outcomes. The aesthetic quality of the outcome is critical and virtue ensures that competition, a powerful impulse is aesthetically acceptable and that functionality follows only good form (efficient, elegant, and tasteful from *any* perspective). Virtue can be seen the practice of turning the competitive impulse upon oneself to cultivate meaningful growth. This is what the Greeks called Arete.

The idea expressed above by Homer is that comfort over time invariably yields discomfort for those who enslave and exploit. They lose their autonomy incrementally by first surrendering the opportunity to express themselves as basic human beings; It begins surreptitiously as they demur on menial tasks, walking or the preparation of meals for example. Spoiled by their accumulated wealth they eat and live lavishly and ever further from the world as it is. In every sense they become removed from reality - how the world is and how people live in it. This carries across generations. Offspring inherit indifference, complacency, insouciance and callousness as much as wealth. The comfort derived from wealth evolves into discomfiture in plain-spoken company as indifference is reciprocated with interest, or rather disinterest (and disdain). This is experienced too by ordinary folk dutifully execute conventional activities yieldlessly (D.E.C.A.Y). Even as these, relatively innocent gather in their various communities, their indifference to the plight of the world leads to sporadic volatility and crude intrusions; they lack the smart perimeters of walled communities. All Inheritance is unearned by definition and therefore leads to compromise in some sense. Signal is lost even in the message of a lesson taught, *even* to the attentive because it lacks the insight of lived experience.

The titans are the celebrated. They are the *giants* who have accumulated capital and entourage. Their use of largess to delegate responsibility diminishes insight and they become systemically unaware. Soon, they are destitute of options to manage strategy because they lack vision in *almost* a literal sense.

Homer's tidy stanza above was expanded upon in a more modern myth, a novel by H.G. Wells in 1899, in *When the Sleeper Wakes*. In it Wells imagines a London where most people have become passive dependents on vast, automated systems and monopolistic corporations, while a small elite governs through mechanized convenience and economic abstraction. The ruling class and their technocrats live lives entirely outsourced to institutions and machines — their food, entertainment, decision-making, even moral life — leaving them spiritually empty and physically enervated.

Outsourcing human responsibility—both personal and civic—creates a form of living death. The masses sleep (literally and figuratively), and the rulers, despite their comfort, are little more than custodians of a machina fueled by animus - war and extraction - from both planet and human identity.

Never doing *any* manual or creative work. Their comfort is total; their decrepit frail bodies and minds dulled by a life of leisure and excess. They are incapable of defending themselves having outsourced courage, labour, and imagination — and in doing so, they lose their humanity and legitimacy:

> “The men of the upper world were scarcely men at all, but effigies of comfort, pale with inactivity and sated pleasure.”

In this world, the elite have grown dependent on their *machina animus*.  They live in a state of privilege becoming ever more infantile and delinquent. The delegation of work, entrenched and layered, they remain blithely unaware of its fragility; it's not so much that their system is prone to collapse but that they are impotent; powerlessly watching what remains of their brightest and bravest defect with ease.

The myth was retold from a different angle by Ayn Rand decades later in *Atlas Shrugged* with its own mysterious *sleepers* John Galt and Dagny Taggart. I encountered the book in 1994. Years later, such was its influence on me that I considered naming my first daughter Dagny. In the end a hardcover edition was my  gift to her when she came away from Western with an Engineering degree precisely so that she might understand *arete*. Finally in the real world, of course, we have Satoshi. 



## компрома

The Russians have a term компрома (*Kompromat*), short for 'compromising material' which since the advent of photography and telephony *usually* referred to embarrassing information about an individual used to influence their behaviour. Previously one's *true* reputation was an aggregate assessment of credibility held within one's socio-economic *strata*.

This idea gets amplified and turned on its head once a money has decisively lost its mooring. The quality of a regimes money dictates the security and comfort if can afford. *De facto* when money has lost its foundation neither security nor comfort can be bought. More profoundly disturbing is that increasingly it is no longer available *de jure*. Judicial systems creak under the weight of codes defined to protect both property and person where increasingly the former has priority over the latter because giants govern and will always place theirs (if not themselves) above the rest. Disparities in outcomes become untenable and indefensible and increasingly even performative expressions of competence leave much to be desired aesthetically.

On the one hand there are those, call them giants holding tenuously to power and willing to do *anything* to anyone to protect their station in society while affecting what they believe to be positive change within increasingly limited constraints. They are heroic, loyal and virtuous, in their minds, as are we all.

The matter at hand however is heroic, loyal and virtuous to what cause? There are some who like the hobbits of Tolkien's Middle Earth perhaps, who want to be left to quietly live untroubled by the cares of the great world. Others, like the Aragorn (a nomadic eternal sleeper) who roams to assess the 'challenge' in his way away from the fray like Galt or Satoshi. He represents a chronicle as good in its way as an Oracle. A student of eternity, he has the knowledge of paths - those of least resistance and those of the most.

One challenge comes from his decadent libertine patriarchy a *Decay Ex Anima*; The arrogant, complacently corrupt Denethor II and decrepit Théoden who resist reform until it is almost too late. Flora and fauna perish and morale declines. The other from authoritarian and coercive challenging patriarchy of Sauron and his ally Saruman assert an I*mperium Ex Machina*. Theirs is a fierce puritanical vision shorn not just of sensuality but all empathy for either anima or its jealous cousin animus. Their machinations will whatever manpower is required, mass produced on dark production lines. This is an almost incoherent vision for us but it is one which Sauron intends for me whose decadence and appetite for opulence threatens to ripple across earth; and as well Saruman who now sets store on his own preservation. Together *Decay Ex Anima* and *Imperium Ex Machina* forge an witting consensus *Concordia Ex Nihilo* - a 'harmony of the nothing, by the nothing, and for the nothing'. This is a power with which nothing *can* live. It is the quietly dull and delicate malice of pure idiocy. It is bought and paid for with a zero-coupon bearer bond of paper called the United States dollar.

Aragorn's peers Boromir and Faramir at Gondor have virtue, loyalty and heroism in spades but lack the ranger's broad scope. It is all periphery all the time. He already know what the core has become - dependent. Whereas Legolas lithe, mobile and ethereal of the long lived Elfin, is a stalwart ally from a tribe with broad insight. The hobbits and their dwarf cousin Gimli are good humoured connoisseurs of merriment and persistent stout journeymen. The three who dwell in forests, mountains, and hillside homes close to life in all its forms add anima to Boromir's strength, steel and aesthetic authority; which he must finally and reluctantly relinquish to his more subtle brother, captain and king Aragorn.

There will always be an Aragorn *is our hope*. He represent the eternal faith rather than a literal truth that life matters and is good. What sets the Fellowship apart is their sense of mortality. They will die - that much they know to be true - and it is *the* defining quality of all that lives. However long or short, life may as well be a journey worth taking. This sort of thing is spoken and written so often as to have become trite and worthless. It can only be understood viscerally through a life lived and survived close to the very edge for it to be absorbed and ring true in action. Which is why so many of us are drawn addictively and tantalizingly close to death in all its forms.

The uncompromising quality that sets Aragorn apart is vision borne of observation and the quiet introspection. When the time came the Fellowship emerged as coalition of the willing and bootstrapped; those with sufficient courage and intelligence to *refine* and reset their loyalty as they gained data. Those with enough patience, humility and skill to challenge and bolster Aragorn's *primus inter pares* leadership as he himself does them to lead a quest against barbarism to end it for all time in the fires of not man but of *Creation* itself.  It is the quiet corruption of the ring that is a barbarous relic - an shiny ornament for the Raven and ravenous. However it is the shards of Narsil made with hard forged alloy and capital well-used handled poorly by a cavalier Boromir which still cuts. It is *true* legacy technology. Still functional even autonomously in the poor hand to impart a lesson.

This is *arete* - each in their station leading in their way and their argument becomes an irresistible rallying point and leads to the fall of the machina animus - and its veritable production line of monsters. For all of Aragorn's vision the one thing he *knew* to resist was the poisoned chalice of that barbarous ring. He preferred the functional - the shards of Narsil cast by men of a plainer 



**Here - FIX.** 

Over time slight compromises are made as ornamental features become an implicit blemish as the functional is neglected as a *compromise*

 over time by those who lead systemically important regime institutions without these accumulating to the point a overhaul is required. 2008 was turning point. Those who hold a  firm line on ethical behaviour began to push back at operating within an incumbent system with its penchant for episodic scapegoats and begin preparing a parallel environment and a transition to the virtual machine - Deus en Machina and *Virtualis*.







**HERE **- spin back quickly to main case.

 They  - and with the faith that there is while there are some things worth living for, something is amiss when people largely appear to know not what they are. 

If you are to question narrow arbitrary authority with any degree of credibility its because you have a broader perspective. It's because your entire frame of reference for the term stakeholder sets you apart. For you all humanity and even beyond it the entire ecology is a stakeholder. If you see then the you're not held back by even the most ordinary standards of propriety as you express a vehement challenge to authority at a moment when you deem it utterly necessary. One who like Joyce would turn the profane into social critique using real life as his stage - how much do you suppose such a one cares how many likes and comments he accumulates. He will go a step further to appal and amaze because these are the times of Ragnarök. In plain terms we have accumulated technical debt and our system design now grinds with the excessive heat and noise of a debt super-cycle coming to a climax.

I was introduced to Arete by Kitto via Robert Pirsig in Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. I came of age steeped in the social sciences particularly history, political science and economics. Then pivoted towards the *real world* and - finance and information technology - to understand , *in practice* rather than theory how the gap between truth and beauty might be better minded. 

> He is in fact an excellent all-rounder; He has surpassing arete; an efficiency which exists, not in one department of life, but in life itself.
~ Kitto



that needed minding - the one between truth and beauty - might actually be closed for good. In assuming an office, a position that requires decisions be made based on values one brooks no compromise on those values without fundamentally impacting one's personal stability (and long-term sustainability). The reality however is that the 





This is particularly important at key cyclical moments - turnings where capital has been debased. Historians may derive considerable information about ordinary conditions for *commoners* in certain periods of time by examining the alloy in coinage, measuring the *adulteration* of silver or gold and then assessing against comparative standards of prosperity and well-being for different classes or 'professional' communities. Without the benefit of the broadly disseminated information we have today (the ultimate capital in any time and place) ordinary folk were at disadvantage. We have solved for this considerably by making market data for commodities freely available however structural impediments or preferences (front-running) still have these communities at a disadvantage. As well, of course there is the underlying unit (the currency) which some economic communities access directly by controlling its volume which unfortunately of course leads to inflation and undermines the autonomy of an individual (by making the ordinary details - food, shelter and clothing more difficult)

and in any case lacking the potential for autonomy we have today, communities in the past (before crypto-economics and the arrival of plausible parallel systems)



 We are geared towards self-actualization: reaching our full potential or being the best versions of ourselves. To some degree we all do this through aspiration to deserve or at least hold positions of authority and prestige - those which command a degree of deference and come with perquisites that are granted to those deemed to have social credit so as to ease the burden of their responsibilities through the provision of comfort and consideration. These 'perks' often become the *object* of ambition rather than the accoutrements of accomplishment. These are the giants - the titans whose self-image is a reflection off the pool that is held as the Commons.

In contrast others demur and, in a mimicry of an alignment of behaviour to ecology or Creation seek to reflect that behaviour. It begins as a studied response to anima which over time becomes intuitive and instinctive. A rapid intelligence that gives (arbitrary) societal norms no room in their ruminations. In mythical terms they look past Caesar to God. In plain terms they no longer wish to be a part of our planet's destruction 



**HERE **- these were darker fuller as gold declined and arsenals grew ever larger (Dial Square?) and ultimately atomic - lighter in the past (Quixote, Jack - pivot to a brighter series of satire (Pangloss/Voltaire too? Picaresque or? - Just Quixote...  - Flip this to end lightly and go long past to balance long future. 

Anarchism, in this framework, is an optimistic perspective. In moments of crisis, while formal authority takes time to organize, ordinary people step in with ad hoc systems that respond immediately to pressing needs. This emerges from a deeply natural sense of empathy and altruism — the simple instinct that it's good to help those in need. When these efforts bear fruit, they bring not only relief but also a sense of fulfillment, camaraderie, and purpose — emotions that many don't experience in their day-to-day jobs. In fact, they may even find they dread returning to the rigidity of traditional work, feeling a deeper connection to the immediate, hands-on nature of problem-solving and mutual aid.

**Arete** (ah-ree-teh) is an ancient Greek term that refers to excellence, virtue, or the fulfillment of purpose or function. In the context of ethics and philosophy, it encompasses the idea of living in accordance with one's highest potential, excelling in specific areas, and demonstrating moral character.

In Greek philosophy, particularly in the works of Aristotle, **arete** is central to his ethical theory. For Aristotle, **arete** meant achieving the highest form of human potential through reason and virtue. It was not just about success or talent in a particular skill, but about flourishing in life by cultivating good character traits, such as courage, wisdom, temperance, and justice. In short, **arete** means living up to the highest standard of your abilities and virtues, embodying the pursuit of excellence in all aspects of life. Arete involves:

1. **Excellence of Character:** Living virtuously by practicing good habits and making morally right decisions.
2. **Achieving Potential:** Striving to reach one’s personal best, in whatever field or role one is engaged in—whether intellectually, physically, or emotionally.
3. **Rational Action:** Acting in alignment with reason and living a life that fulfills one's function or purpose, as it aligns with human nature.
4. **Balance of Virtues:** Arete doesn't mean being perfect in a single aspect, but developing a [well-rounded character](https://transition-insight.com/research-%26-writing/f/the-hero-of-odyssey?blogcategory=Dictum+(Soul+of+Wit)), balancing traits like courage with temperance, and wisdom with generosity. 













## Jack

We are uniquely imbued as creatures with the power of imagination and creativity. It is to be wielded with humility and the sum of our collective wisdom to manifest Regnum Dei. It demands the open-hearted (any colour you want as long as it's black) Jack of Clubs. He's a master of none who seeks to live and let live. It's the *Giant that walks above him* who would break him *for* bread...

*Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. Be he alive, or be he dead, I'll grind his bones to make my bread* 

Anyone who has planted a garden understands that creation will only yield comfort for the *devoted* constant gardener *-* one who shows care, attention and applied focus to what he sows where, how and when. In the tale of Jack and the Beanstalk, only the credulously infantile reads of a quickly sprouting stalk and dreams of fabulous wealth earned (number go up). This is a story of merit; of a peasant but one who knows what great fortune it is to be human - one who might trade chattel for seed and still yet flourish upward to raid and slay the hoarding giant who would prey and feast on his marrow - for him time stands still for he is in flow - this is Godspeed. Jack, like Thoreau wishes to "live deep and *suck* out all the marrow of *life*, to live so sturdily and Spartan-like as to put to rout all that [is] not life". The word in Sanskrit for that which provides the contentment that suffices - is सुख (*sukh*). Thoreau as a student of Hindu scripture certainly understood this -  he speaks of the Bhagavad Gita (Song Celestial) in *Walden.*

Jack wishes to extinguish the Giant - and foremost, any remnant of the Giant that lies within him - his ego and instead of seeking the prestige of rank at the cost of another (and his marrow), prefer to absorb as much as he can from that scarcest currency - the life he has been granted by creation.



## Quixote

The Giant in mythology and literature is occasionally an impoverished wastrel rather than hoarder - a self-styled extravagant noble. Take Don Quixote the Hidalgo who squanders what little wealth he has on learning and collecting the gestures, symbols, and paraphernalia of chivalry instead of expressing nobility through effort and thought in the application of a Call to Adventure (in any vocation whatsoever). Quixote is no mad man; he is merely drunk on the rituals, traditions, courtesies and privileges afforded to nobility who are assigned rank without merit. The fraudulent noble is worse than the luddite (for these are graceful windmills set amongst bucolic pasture against which they tilt and not the dark satanic mills of exploitation). He has a sense of entitlement expressed as the monopoly of seigniorage - all capital beyond that which the serf requires to subsist - there is no such thing as social recovery. For him *l'etat est moi* - all rights are reserved for him alone.  He is an embattled knight - the hollowed out shell of Goliath - the feudal dominion over serfs and he who lords over all with comprehensive eminent domain - even body, minds and souls of those who dwell upon the land. The retrograde would rather look back to his opulence and revert to an earlier instance of Leviathan than cast his vision to the future. For the anarchist Jack - The 'Wind' Milne and Christ's Breath - it is a matter of *l'etat et moi (*until he might negotiate for his 'planet come together' a more reasonable bargain - for all). Seigniorage must be dispensed equitably with the automaticity of monism.

**We Are Spirits In The Material World**

The windmill represents the harnessing of that holy ghost which has the capacity to animate virtue in any corpus that provides fertile ground and whose collective outcomes are manifested as the *market.* It is the market's enabled ingenuity - technology - that affords distributive and equitable wealth. Chomsky questioned the need for a full-time policy making-class engaged in public (social engineering) or private (corporatist) capital allocation and preferred that organic communities develop; ones geared to collaborative behaviour and an acceptance of free open and transparent markets as the arbiter of outcomes. This was (and is) model of the broadly successful kibbutzim model - a template to emulate and scale. This market is our collective soul (spirits) in the material world which the Police express with their brand of dissident English fusion (Regatta de Blanc).

There is no political solution To our troubled evolution Have no faith in constitution There is no bloody revolution

We are spirits in the material world 

Our so-called leaders speak With words they try to jail you They subjugate the meek But it's the rhetoric of failure

We are spirits in the material world 

Where does the answer lie? Living from day to day If it's something we can't buy There must be another way ~  The Police ([Spirits In The Material World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BHOevX4DlGk))

The windmill is a manifestation of our creativity; it is the work of a *Milne* - who through moments of introversion - meditations upon his craft - gleans insights to harness creation and yield comfort for a transition - a planet coming together. This combination of nouse and labour amidst creation is the Christ's breath. Jack's curiosity makes him a potential natural at whatever he tries his hand. He knows not of Kings - he would hang them high. He himself is the instrument of *Christ* the King - Thor's hammer or David's sling if you like - the star and angel on the tree of life, Christian, and still yet pagan.

The Kings of the Wild Frontier - the secure nodes of the Prehistoric Ledger - epitomize Jack's mentality. We were not born slaves but were free men in the wilderness and profoundly curious, even thrilled to see how working together we might harness our wits to serve collective mind and soul, eking out at first the barest of subsistence and then genuine *sufficient* comfort. We didn't split the work equally but rather equitably allocating based on our innate qualities - a pareto distributive mechanism that emphasized efficiency and a labour of love for the ones we love. When we succumb to material excess beyond earned courtesy and deference - an easement that aims only to *facilitate the efficient delivery* of work  - our tribes waned. In the Christian era we have seen the descent and renaissance of our own western civilization - one which is registered in the myths of a European pagan tribe. When the civilizational pressures at home forced a group of them to discover new found land, they reckoned with desolation and failed to come to grips with a peaceable approach to dealing with the indigenous and subsequently perished.



Canada has a distinct European origin story in the Western Hemisphere. Norsemen—Vikings are our original European tribe. They made landfall in Newfoundland around 1000 AD, five centuries before Columbus reached Hispaniola. Many of these warrior-farmers paid homage to the Norse gods of Aesir, including Thor (left) and his hammer. Among their myths was Ragnarök, an apocalyptic battle between gods and giants that mirrors end-times narratives across many ancient cultures.

In our Anthropocene nuclear age, Ragnarök is a resonant cautionary tale. Like the Haudenosaunee - the people who occupied the land I now dwell upon, the Norse took a long view of history and their deepest nightmare featured an epic struggle whose outcome is yet to be decided. Elsewhere that nightmare myth became reality—the Old World visited an irreversible cataclysm upon the thriving civilizations of the New; the colonial lesson is there for both those who vanquished and those who conquered: evolve, adapt, unite and love; or else might *will* make right, tear through each house in turning inward, as it did through El Colon.

My own ancestral traditions of India have their own pantheon of Gods; one of whom, Shiv, the God of Destruction, was invoked by Oppenheimer when he uttered Hindu scripture (the Bhagavad Gita) upon ushering in our nuclear era: 'Now I am become Death, the destroyer of worlds'. Oppenheimer belonged to a generation of often melancholy, spiritually enlightened intellectuals (Einstein and Bohm are others) who in their exploration into the realms of the sub-atomic particle and theoretical mathematics realized that the Universe wasn't just queer - but that it had a queerness that transcended comprehension and human thought itself. This revelation imbued them with *enormous* humility - for they understood that for all of their schooling, careful examination of the material world and contemplation, what they had come full circle in old age to know was how little they really understood and how careful humanity needed to be in attempting to model reality with a view to affect change in the world. It was this forlorn understanding that prompted Oppenheimer to invoke the Destroyer of Worlds as a mere mortal who understood the danger posed by the hubris of Giants who would engineer society at its cost as citizenry or consumer to serve themselves.



Turn him to any cause of policy, The Gordian knot of it he will unloose, Familiar as his garter: that when he speaks, The air, a charter’d libertine, is still, And the mute wonder lurketh in men’s ears, To steal his sweet and honey’d sentences,

~ Sir William Shakespeare (From Henry V)

Extraordinary lines those, from Shakespeare, express the foundation of monism -  a free spirit in the atmosphere that rejects dogma and imposition of orthodoxy. It insists that one finds direct experience with God (right action or virtue). One doesn't associate the *American experiment* with social engineering precisely because Americans generally think of it as the deliberate imposition of frameworks that are only notionally collectivist to guide outcome. It chafes against the philosophical anarchy that I am so drawn to - that quintessentially American contribution to political philosophy inspired by Revolutionary French and its sponsor in the founding of American Republic - Thomas Jefferson; that too professed by the American transcendentalists, not least of all their poet laureate Walt Whitman. The counterculture was the remergence of that communalism in response to the effective but stifling postwar conformity of the 1950s. However it was a *mostly* ineffectual and promiscuously self-indulgent outburst. It expressed a rejection of norms without proposing alternatives (as expressed say in powerfully constructive ways of Mennonite, Amish and Mormon antecedents). It was therefore decisively rejected by the 'silent majority' Nixon consensus (notably the California Republican was himself a Quaker). The counterculture turned out not to be the hoped for revolutionary road because truth matters and without an acknowledgement of universally accepted truths there cannot be faith in humanity's future and this is the essence of having doubt where faith is required, in creation - for its custodian is derelict. No truth is more universal than this: Life and its base currency (time) is sacred.

Americans prefer instead what they refer to as market forces with the enabling of *economy* the ultimate imperative. The challenge of course is infantilism and intellectual maturity in a large population that doesn't readily absorb and accept philosophy and is therefore ill-equipped to wield the entailed personal sovereignty. Elsewhere, even in Canada and Britain we are more receptive to the idea right of having some kind of guiding principle for evolving our political economy; it is why we in governance reserve for ourselves the obligation to firmly reapply 'peace and order' should good governance fail in the British North America Act of 1867. There is consensus on this which is why political parties are generally less polarized than in the United States - and all of us are satisfied and reaffirm our decision to embark on a different vision of nation. Where we differ among us is the degree to which which we delegate application of policy to private and public administrative bodies - including quasi-governmental and non-governmental ones. 

However Americans are getting a society that is engineered in ways that no American could be particularly happy about. The notion of a Deep State has a conspiratorial ring, however what it really implies is that firm control of macro policy has become impossibly difficult as the scope of government and the size of the administrative apparatus metastasized; in place of what we might call deliberate data-driven outcome-oriented governance with the transparent traceability of a Merkel tree we get instead a manufactured consent inside of a Gordian knot; an enigmatic narrative wrapped inside of a puzzle that cannot be unencrypted and which requires severance of errant strands to break apart and arrest the dire prognosis - a cancer of the body politic - because it delivers outcomes that are satisfy a plurality of interests in a given contextual instance (the atomic transactional*)* but whose net outcome over the long run is reflexively sub-optimal resulting in a large and growing quantity of accumulated aggregated social debt and nominal (monetary) debt.

An ethical and spiritual take is that Zero-Layer Governance has within it a persistent 'Azazel' consensus mechanism *In Machina* that alarms everyone but that nobody is sufficiently motivated or courageous to resolve due to their systemic entrenchment; everybody cheats a little (or so they say) but inside an opaque mechanism perverse competitive incentives add enormous systemic strain - moral hazard is difficult enough to manage in broad daylight never mind behind the wizard's curtain. I expect there is a certain  amount of peer pressure with ostracism the price for not taking full advantage of your privileged access. There are, of course, red lines. But the existence of these mechanisms suggests that some level of amnesty and forbearance may be both practical and necessary if we are to move forward with institutional reform. And yet, having spent time in the General Prison Population (let's call it an *ad hoc* field exercise) and having seen how many poor, unfortunate souls languish in jail without having done much wrong, I feel a deep frustration. The same system that tolerates excesses in high places seems far less forgiving to those at the bottom. 

In practical terms the need to delegate to *institutionally* trusted agents becomes imperative; elected officials at the highest levels are hamstrung by having to 'split the difference' between various constituencies while vying for office. Meanwhile legislatures are captured by capital-rich interests that hold their incumbent agents captive through gerrymandered constituencies.

Eisenhower warned of this military-industrial complex and the spectre of its deep state reach in the service of corporate wealth and their indolent 'investors' the *world* over. The catalogue of international transgressions is a long and depressing one and even the list of those against democratically elected governments is too long for me to list here.

**Giant Money Problem**

When foreign sources have been thoroughly plundered, the deep state turns inward, financializing its own economy and condemning large swaths of the poor and unemployed to opioid-induced death—courtesy of Big Pharma and its monstrous Health Plan Industrial Complex. Then, as the petro-dollar begins to fail, it sets its sights on oil once more in Kuwait and Iraq. Ironically, the bloodletting continued in Afghanistan—home to organic, golden-brown heroin—a potential salve for those of us who tire of this repetitive strain. 

In stark contrast to the beautiful minds of Oppenheimer, Einstein and Bohm who might have blushed at praise stands the Committee to Save the World - The well-heeled trio who graced the cover of Time magazine in 1999 (below) on the cusp of the new millennium without the slightest hint of either self-awareness nor irony. You wonder whether they were conned into it. Mid-20th century classical economists, those that followed Paul Samuelson, were at least earnest in their studiously insistent and simplistic modeling of reality's complexity but here you have three men; false prophets of a hollowed out faith in profits - apologists for Goliath and a fraudulent hegemony - first round draft picks to stick-handle the fallout.

Nothing better encapsulates the core issue than this photograph (left): the full-time policy-making class is mired in sclerosis and paid for with a broken coin. Bloated bureaucracies—both public and private—combine with gerrymandered elected officials to create a logjam so severe that governance is increasingly outsourced to co-opted corporate officers; decision-making is deferred to entities for whom security has never been a priority especially when it comes at the expense of capital gains, annual bonuses, or stock option packages. 

In an era where humanity’s intellectual wealth is freely accessible, Larry Summers defends exorbitant tuition at and bloated administration at Harvard. Meanwhile, there's Citigroup at the epicenter of the 2007 financial crisis, fueled by reckless subprime lending, with Robert Rubin—its Chairman—at the helm. And presiding over it all, the Wizard of Odd himself, Alan Greenspan, ensuring that the keeps printing greenbacks as Federal Reserve Chair. The while the other two looked to disperse their Cantillon largess as Secretaries of the Treasury.

I've been strong in my criticisms here, in part because I bought into their credibility as a younger man. I feel the genuine disappointment of one who might have been a journeyman among their ranks - even an aspiring protégé. In any case, it is well past due the institutions they once represented retool - and posthaste.

**Endgame - The Battle Is Joined** 

My fixation of course is the resolution and reconciliation of civilizational cyclicality and the small matter of managing delivery and (good) governance after peace and order is established; to avoid Armageddon, mitigate collateral damage along the way and ease ourselves into the *singularity* (the ecstasy of the Rapture) - an age of plenty for all with a secure robust currency that holds value in pockets deep and shallow. We want a planet come together; where an  credible and universally accepted notion of return on investment is transparently expressed; where capital ownership is sovereign to the individual - who has the capacity to apply it as he wishes transparently to all so that he may be judged as an instrument of monism and object of trust. The alternative in the age of mass destruction (nuclear arms) and distraction (social media) is a final denouement; the admittedly impressive and darkly nihilistic ambition: The first ever self-induced sleep walk into mass extinction - euthanasia at military-industrial scale.

The sub-plot within the grinding wheel turning us towards oblivion is the tension between kings and slaves as the latter pull away from the former in a journey along Jacks, Bobby's and Martin's moral arc of the universe - towards freedom and justice. This is linearity and its unfolding story of upward progress albeit also of periodically steep drawdowns. Linearity pulls us towards reconciliation while the modalities of tradition and heritage push us away from it. The elastic band that comprises humanity expands and contracts and a coming together seems perpetually out of scope - until it is in sight and then finally insight yields results - transition - to a New World Order.

**Ragnarök Redux**

As I work these themes in my writing and  look for partnership to help resolve them on the ground in the delivery of information technology, I explore the realm of popular culture where it makes more and more frequent appearances as the zeitgeist catches on to our reality. The arts and entertainment industry throws up some subtle comic relief occasionally. 

On Netflix a show called Ragnarök is a Norwegian retelling of that *End of Times* myth. Set in a small fictional Norwegian town, Edde, both blight-ridden and picturesque quietly nestled amongst the fjords an epic battle between Gods and Giants plays out.

The story unfolds as the townsfolk grapple with the environmental issues of climate change and industrial pollution, primarily caused by the local industrial power player and fifth largest company in Norway(!) Jutul Industries owned by the Jutul family. The Jutuls are depicted as jötnar—supernatural beings, or Giants, from Norse mythology—disguised as humans; This can be viewed as narrative device presenting the centralization of power and capital through heritage and descendance - one that endows oligarchy with power over the commons; A formidable capability yielding ROI on the outside (public key) while wielding influence on the inside (private key) leveraging the aforementioned 'manufactured' consent. These Giants are dualists par - everyone else is merely a tool or an ally to be corrupted and co-opted.

**If I Had A Hammer**

The narrative centers on Magne, a dyslexic teenage boy who discovers he is the reincarnation of Thor, the Norse god of thunder; a random good deed he does without the expectation of compensation is blessed by an elderly cashier at the local SPAR grocery. The narrative device here is the tenets of *virtue* are passed on generationally and are available to all - whether they are great or common - the choice is ours as to whether we adhere to them or not.

Between the new avatar of Thor and the giants lie the masses who are caught in the trawl net of Giants. They have drifted far from virtue as values become untethered from price and denomination (in currency we no longer have faith and whatever denomination you choose Kraft Dinner costs more daily and you're left with less brass in pocket). 

Mesmerized by *Maya,* and unable to express *Lila* on the stage of life, YOLO indulgence is an option for the youth of Edde as they look out to an increasingly incoherent world as some unseen power appears top fritter away their collective inheritance, the Planet. Adults have either junkie-succumbed to YOLO or they have opted for the D.E.C.A.Y. of David Graeber's Bullshit Jobs (dutifully executing conventional activities *yieldlessly*).

An agent of meaningful change regardless (whether as just a good kid or God) Magne is initially incredulous about his new-found powers and opts for conventional and administrative routes as an agent for meaningful change - writing school reports, raising awareness in the community *and* filing whistleblower reports with local law enforcement as he begins his epic to duel with the Giants.

The subtle hilarity is the manner in which the Giants join battle with Thor: By undermining his social credit at school and in the community. He gets expelled from school (a failing grade on a paper that highlights environmental hazards) and having the local psychiatric clinic prescribe him anti-psychotics to undermine his social credit. When all else fails, there is for the giants an absurd final solution - risperidone. I'm not 'Thor' literally but I can relate. I was in a impatient ward and prescribed risperidone for a bit (let's call it field experiment). I guess they think we're insane - when instead there is crystal clear method to our madness.

I've selected a 'fairy' tale (about Jack), a story of Gods (Thor, Ragnarök and his risperidone script) and a classic novel (Don Quixote and his triste with a Milne) - three 'myths' to express key ideas in productivity; which is the essence of turning time into that which has currency - meaning for the self and for the commons manifested in the current - a word which means in motion (flow) and the present (still). This is why money is *always* yield it is notional in both senses - otherwise it's a commodity such as gold - no doubt valuable to a human but only as stable element with useful industrial properties. 

I explore these ideas in Part 2 of this series driving us from macro (public) down to the micro (private) to model Regnum Dei (governance). All of this because from my anarchist perspective governance of the commons requires first a governance of the self (hence E Pluribus Unum). In software architecture we use the term stateful for that  which is public and which maintains equivalency to the aggregation of private states - essentially expressing the idea of E Pluribus Unum in real-time. I think of this as being in a *solid pukka united state*. It is complete (hard) yet ripe (as fruit when it has yield - extractable value); to be sure it's constantly evolving but it is *universally definitive* at a precise moment in time.
