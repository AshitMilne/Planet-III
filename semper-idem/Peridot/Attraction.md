**Have You Got Yourself An Occupation?**

Those lyrics above speak to the simplistic exhortations of a sovereign to the idealism of young men (and now women) to sacrifice their lives for or a an idea whilst the privileged find away to dodge that same responsiblity. War is the random and wanton destruction of the 'other' and only one word suffices for it - crime.* Only people (one or more humans) decide to go to war by executing it by others who are guilty of 'following orders' or 'doing their job' at the very least against others who are doing precisely the same thing. This is '[mechanical turk](https://www.mturk.com/) for dummies' (anyone naive, lazy or psychopathic) to take a job that entails randomly killing or censoring the 'other' then delegates to another the task of carrying out the task with 'patriotism' as the justification. This is why Churchill called it the *last* refuge of a scoundrel. It is the simplistic who pay the price with their life. My own anarchist perspective is that all existing contracts including the so-called *default* currency are null and void. I believe there would be consensus on this in what I consider my philosophical leadership**

The story is told in scripture with Abraham's offering of his son Isaac as a literal sacrifice. This denotes a moment of surrender to a power greater than he. Abraham's wisdom is made narrow and clear with an orthodoxy. His is the Lord's hand on earth and he is unwilling to surrender his son to a life of penury and enslavement. He would sooner sacrifice him to creation than deliver him to powers that will make of him a 'mechanical turk' of their bidding. This is the orthodoxy and surrender to the creation (Brahma) that will sustain (Vishnu) us - but not to a Caesar - and this is anarchy. In the story, a ram appears and its sacrifice denotes the transmutation of energy and matter by creation into sustenance (the moveable feast of nomadic husbandry). Contrast this to the transmutation offered by the Caesar of the dollar and its promise of paper wage for life - it is literally a 'promissory note' - wrung from a tree that would have been better left in the ground. Now you understand the meaning of faith and have no need for religion nor hope for a better future because it's to be found here and now with your bare hands and the insight which guides them. Transition.

Rigidity and orthodoxy imply a basic understanding of truths that cannot be translated clearly to another nor fully appreciated unless it already *understood*. These basic facts are for children - so that as adults they do not need interpretation. This is what we mean by direct experience and the notion that religious experiences come in many varieties. All is for naught if we *compromise* and are through an accumulation of such compromises made *compliant* to structures and institutions who are not concomitant to those basic truths (or promises). If the foundational constitutional frameworks are not adhered to in practice then the edifice constructed atop is always profoundly flawed. Code requires orthodox adherence. No line of code can be written, assembled and compiled in any language and to be processed in different ways towards different outcomes for different people. The results will be incoherent and inchoate (as they are today).

**The Bullshit Job**

A degree of agility and mobility together with an acute capacity for divination through introspection is demanded of those who will respond to their circumstances and the story of Job is one that illustrates this.

Job is a wealthy and upright man who lives in the land of Uz. He is described as “blameless” and “upright,” one who “fears God and shuns evil.” He has a large family, wealth, and is pious. God praises Job’s righteousness. But Satan (literally “the Accuser” in Hebrew) challenges God: he argues that Job is only faithful because his life is comfortable. If he were to suffer, Satan says, he would curse God.

God permits Satan to test Job—first by destroying all his possessions and children, and then, when Job remains faithful, by afflicting him with painful sores. Job, now childless, destitute, and diseased, sits on an ash heap, scraping his sores with broken pottery. Implicit here is that the comfort many of us enjoy cannot objectively be justified while so many both in our own countries and certainly those further afield suffer deep destitution. Job's complacency and insensitivity is the cause of his trials. Whatever work he has done may have been done with fertile seed (bull) planted in soil (*good seasoned* shit) but too much is still lost in the whole for it to be truly righteous and so it is taken from him before he has developed the conscience to understand his plight and ultimately, his sins. 'Job' security is a fraud whose aim is to make one perpetually insecure. This is what David Graeber [meant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs).

There is satisfaction in creative endeavor to be found in the 'bullshit job' until there isn't - that point when the ROI (return on investment) becomes negligible for you. Then it is time to be self-sovereign (Roi) and realize that one has enough to make more of himself in pursuit of a greater good with partnership and community that is aligned on values.This is attraction and is not to be confused with temptation or of being led into trespass by it. This is *good* work and we have no need to sever our soul from the work that is demanded of us by taking in return something of no value merely because others arbitrarily assign it through fiat as though they were God; so that there is ever less toil and ever more flow and no need of toll, tax nor even tithe*** as the greater hourglass fills our (collective) glass without the empty promises and apologies of a Santa nor the accusations of Satan - who amount to the same thing; a giant, Goliath or Leviathan who led us into temptation.

*The very notion of 'war crimes' is absurd from an anarchist perspective. War may be in fact waged successfully against failing institutions and their compromised agents without resort to violence or even civil resistance. It requires a degree of creativity - art is never for its own sake and the soldier always pays a price but only to himself hence the need for the radical creative to sustain self whilst immersed in vocation.

Based on common usage and psychological frameworks, the distinction people make between being attracted and being tempted hinges on two key factors: **action** and **moral/social consequence**.

- **Attraction** is generally seen as an **internal state or feeling**. It's the initial pull or interest toward something or someone. For instance, you can be attracted to a new car, a person's personality, or a beautiful piece of art. It's a foundational emotional or aesthetic response that doesn't necessarily imply action or a negative outcome.
- **Temptation**, on the other hand, is seen as a **call to action** that involves a potential conflict with one's established principles, goals, or social norms. It's the desire to do something you know you shouldn't. The word itself carries a connotation of risk and potential failure, suggesting a struggle between a momentary desire and a long-term value. For example, a person on a diet might be attracted to a delicious dessert, but they are *tempted* to eat it because doing so would go against their goal. 

The core difference is that while **attraction is a feeling, temptation is a test.**

People often say "we occupy ourselves or occupy them" to describe a relentless pursuit of activity and stimulation. This observation likely stems from the belief that humans have a fundamental aversion to idleness and boredom.

We occupy ourselves and others to avoid boredom for several reasons:

- **Aversion to Introspection:** Unstructured time can lead to deep introspection, confronting difficult thoughts, anxieties, or insecurities that we prefer to avoid. Activities serve as a distraction from these internal realities.
- **Social Expectations:** Modern society values productivity, busyness, and constant engagement. Being "occupied" is often seen as a sign of success, importance, and purpose.
- **The Pursuit of Novelty:** Humans are wired to seek novelty and stimulation. Continuous activity provides a steady stream of new information and experiences, fulfilling this inherent drive.

------

If we were bored for a while, it could lead to several outcomes, both constructive and destructive, depending on how it's handled:

**Positive Outcomes:**

- **Creativity and Innovation:** Boredom forces the mind to wander and seek new connections. It frees up cognitive resources from external tasks, allowing for original thoughts and problem-solving. Some of history's greatest inventions and artistic breakthroughs were born from moments of idleness and reflection.
- **Increased Self-Awareness:** Without external distractions, we are forced to sit with our thoughts and feelings. This can lead to a deeper understanding of our desires, fears, and motivations, fostering personal growth.
- **Mindfulness and Presence:** Boredom can teach us to be more present in the moment and to find interest in our immediate surroundings, leading to a greater appreciation for simple things.

**Negative Outcomes:**

- **Restlessness and Anxiety:** Many people find boredom to be deeply uncomfortable. This can manifest as increased restlessness, irritability, and anxiety as the mind struggles to find an outlet for its energy.
- **Destructive Behaviors:** To escape the discomfort of boredom, some people may turn to destructive behaviors such as excessive drinking, binge eating, gambling, or other risky activities to seek a quick fix of stimulation.

------

Boredom at an occupation is a form of **reactive boredom**, whereas boredom through introspection is a form of **proactive boredom**.

- **Boredom at an Occupation:** This is a feeling of listlessness, stagnation, or disinterest that arises from an external, often repetitive or unfulfilling task. This type of boredom is typically a negative signal, indicating that the activity isn't engaging one's skills or providing a sense of purpose. It's something you want to escape.
- **Boredom through Introspection:** This is a deliberately created state of mental quiet, free from external stimulation. Instead of being caused by an unfulfilling task, it's a chosen lack of a task. It's a proactive mental space where the mind is given room to wander inward.

------

Your assumption that boredom through introspection leads to self-care rather than self-abuse is a perspective many people, myself included, would agree with. While the initial discomfort of confronting one's thoughts can be challenging, the ultimate outcomes are often positive.

Here's why this distinction is crucial:

- **Reactive Boredom and Self-Abuse:** The boredom felt at a repetitive job can lead to a search for quick, external stimulation to escape the mental discomfort. This can manifest as escapist and sometimes self-destructive behaviors like excessive social media scrolling, substance abuse, or emotional eating. The self-abuse isn't a direct result of the boredom itself, but rather the reaction to it as the individual desperately tries to fill the void.
- **Proactive Boredom and Self-Care:** Boredom through introspection, however, is a chosen path. By sitting with your thoughts, you are, in essence, performing a form of **mental self-care**. This intentional quiet time can lead to a deeper understanding of one's own needs and desires. It's about listening to yourself, which can lead to:
  - **Clarity:** It allows you to sort through cluttered thoughts and identify what truly matters to you.
  - **Creativity:** The idle mind is free to make novel connections, leading to innovative ideas and solutions.
  - **Emotional Regulation:** It helps you become more comfortable with your own feelings, whether good or bad, without needing to distract yourself from them.

In short, the type of boredom that leads to a positive outcome is a **deliberate and mindful state**, not a circumstantial one. It's the difference between being a **passive victim of boredom** and an **active participant** in it.
