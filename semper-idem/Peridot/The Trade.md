**Note:** The purpose here is to define the term *trade*. Its meaning has changed over time, a shift that accelerated as information came to be transmitted more widely and rapidly—first via telegraph and telegram (analog cable), then through telephony, radio, and television (analog, then digital wireless), and ultimately through the internet, where digital precision now approaches the speed of light, with minimal lag between transmission and receipt.

Trade: the word's origins are of two strands. Firstly we speak of learning a trade. Hence, we once spoke of tradesmen (butchers, bakers, candlestick makers and their ilk) whereas now we speak of traders. Secondly and related to the evolving usage of the term, merchants and shopkeepers maintained a store of inventory to be exchanged for due consideration in legal tender at a price determined at a point in time - this too was seen a trade. My father, a newsagent and confectionist would speak of having done so much 'in trade' on a given day. Christmas Eve being a particularly fruitful day for trade.

In conversation as shop keepers, we spoke of stock keeping (we managed the supply of inventory to clear 'dead stock' - things for which there was no longer a ready market demand. The trade itself was comprised of the yield - the margin between the cost of *carrying* (purchasing and keeping) inventory secure and the price for which it was transferred to customers. This was the 'reward', if you will, for being a market-maker - one of many in a decentralized system for the transference of value that ranged through the boroughs and counties in that 'nation of shopkeepers' called England. The French use of that term was derogatory but we wore the *sobriquet;* making it our own in our small-holder ownership of free enterprise in a greater whole; and just as we made the planet's lingua franca our own, so too our notions of exchange were *Threadneedled* through the realm so that a macroeconomic sense of yield was established *Pax Britannica.* There was no sliding scale for prices. No unearned courtesies or privileges. All shapes and classes stood and paid 'together' (the same price) just as they might have once sat and prayed together - as though all were, God-willing, equal. Whatever policies established in Parliament and Whitehall for the realm, the idea of enterprise was practiced in the shop; the high street's firm hand was an ever ready disciplinarian for the aberrant rent-seeker or careless-taker.

The 'protocol' for making a market admitted no bias even as much of the data that set prices was anecdotal. There was of course the MSRP, but as well a general sense through conversation of was appropriate carried on within this network. These nodes were physical establishments of brick and mortar - gathering places for conversation between strangers and acquaintances alike. Goodwill - an encapsulation of intellectual property denoting trust, relational (or contextual) capital and legitimacy was a part of the equation. A sweet location, clean premises, the right measure of courtesy, familiarity and propriety for each customer. In a word, culture and values - within a greater context - the same one that had us easing through roundabouts and queuing patiently for the bus with an innate collective authority dictating the give and go (nobody's ever on 'the take' the way we play). At the point of the transaction the coming together is a humanist one. At the very least it has the smartness and solidity of the cleanly objective data-driven vending machine and at its precisely customary it has the pukka ripeness of the Muslim Off License keeper who sells tall cans to the lad from the corner shop because his Dad's too busy to get away before it closes for the night. It’s a proximate trade — one grounded in shared spaces and relationships — that lends the cold lines on the ticker or receipt a measure of warmth and coherence*. Call it an organic, earned courtesy: The sort of thing that machines might one day approximate, but for now only ever approach from a distance. For now, it remains a bar that decentralized systems aspire to clear — not through brute logic, but through trust made visible. 

Historically, trade began as proximity—a closeness of need and surplus, of trust and risk. Before the abstraction of tokens and markets, there was only the proximate: the neighbor, the passerby, the guest. What was traded was not just grain or cloth but recognition, even reverence. The earliest trades were sacred because they established not just economic bonds, but human ones. I don't pretend that shopkeeping was a sacred thing but isn't that the idea of a contract? It is a deed in a deed that is unwritten and only expressed by a solid bond in your heart to another. No matter how emotionally proximate the relationship, you make eye contact; skin's in the game as paper and coin is exchanged in the tentative handshake between worlds—between values, between strangers, between selves across time. It arises not in the marketplace, but in the moment we recognize that another holds something we desire and that we hold something we can offer in kind. Trade is *empathy* operationalized. The trades we learn and execute as adults we do so in the beginning with orthodoxy  learned from our *best* teachers and they are know best because they understand when orthodoxy must yield to humanity - when it is innocent and honest. 

As you consider my explanation of the trade now think on the way centralized entities  carry on a profitable trade in the data you transact with; *your data* constitutes *you* to the world online. Not just with exchange-listed instruments of debt and equity but also the exceedingly valuable information about who you are, what you like, and what you need and even who you might care to know or love — revealed through your social media and browser activity. What empathy do you see operationalized here? Does it sufficiently in your view encapsulate legitimacy, credibility, neutrality and transparency? The internet is a profoundly important endowment even as it stands - we're fortunate to have it. But that doesn't mean a thorough examination of how it is currently constituted amounts to looking a gift-horse in the mouth. The aim here was to demystify through a metaphor from my own personal story the secure networks emerging in proof-of-stake protocols that transact data on *fair* terms. When the dust settles and the vapid speculative Degen fervour ebbs away (as it will just as pets.com did) what we'll be left with what really *counts -* the human-centric values underwriting these on-chain rules (and the pets who hopefully still love us). These rules will better interpret and execute flow as we ourselves operate transparently and in a fashion that allows our identity to be abstracted and our intentions to be cleanly read.

There is too the question of whether in fact the 'retail' investor should even be trading at all. I once owned a diversified portfolio between around 2002 to 2008 and would rebalance across sectors once a quarter. The companies I owned were ones I cared or at least had more than a passing interest and understood. They were Canadian ones (and *only* Canadian ones): CAE, Lululemon, Torstar, Canada Trust, Potash Corp, Loblaws, Imperial Oil and so on. They were real businesses with yield in a currency I used and recognized as having real value. It wasn't a passive endeavour and I'm not interested in conversations on their ESG or DEI merits, only to say that were genuine - real employees who cared about what they did and whose companies made goods and services that found a ready market in our country. You don't trade these any more than you engage in trade people (slavery - which continues but in 'baked' slices - cookies for example.) Companies, like communities are for liking or leaving. We choose to stake or we choose not to.

Above I mocked the idea that homes have become a generic asset such that they are deemed fungible (like pennies) and traded purely for speculative gain but how much less absurd is it that real companies created by founders should become such? It's offensive that they bounce too many times across a bid/ask spread for nothing save profit. That *really* started to happen in 2008 when value was 'collapsed'; the quants now had the edge trading at light speed to arbitrage points on nanoseconds of advantage for pure (US) dollar profit. They were entirely indifferent to the specific nature of what was being traded looking instead for 'alpha' (beating the market in generating return). Worse than that, even the nature of the firm began to change - with an alternative narrative to the one presented prima facie. A primary example was my last employer Thomson Reuters which at times appeared to be a more of a blunt data- gathering engine for Palantir and its various US border and security patrons than *just* a 'corporate tax and law engine' (what was I thinking?)

*That* is when the network, its legitimacy and credibility really began to matter to me. When I started to become invested in securing the network by applying serious money to protocols (Solana and Ethereum) versus the increasingly commodified things that ran on incumbent centralized rails - including you - and then routinely subjected to ham-fisted surveillance by 'Team America' (fuck yeah). It's also why I ultimately I disengaged from employment at passively traded enterprises (if you can even call them that anymore) to instead write, explore alternative modes of governance, and just chill.

*This is an opportunity to draw a distinction between say, moral relativism and contextually empathic ethical behaviour. It would be unethical, most would argue and I agree, for an adult is possession of a liquor license to serve teens in a group expressing a rebel posture (carrying bags of Evo Stik and sporting 'mohicans' and generally being rowdy - because it defies logic and commons sense) or even a smartly attired but already inebriated adult - even a pedestrian (because it's against the Sovereign's revenue generating priorities). But serving a well-known neighbour's 'Hindu' eight year old son who actually seems a bit embarrassed to be buying Carlsberg Special Brew is really about using common sense that comes with along with a track record of gathered information (data) to snub the Sovereign and do right by community and ultimately Creation when you think about it. By the way, this attitude *is* cockney mentality. It's highly effective - especially when bolstered with political passive-aggression - pacifism, irony, activism and a comprehensive refusal of the sovereign. For example: one does not march in protest - it's a waste of energy - particularly against governments we imagine do not exist. Nor do we pay taxes (we are flaneurs and deliberately maintain our income levels at exceedingly low levels precisely to avoid taxation *and* representation *legally.*) Authority finds this behaviour awkward and simply has no response; there's an interesting superficial naivete (just for presentation to the public) expressed by incumbents in liberal democracy and they are nonplussed when those they claim as their own (clean, messy and clever in all the right ways) air 'inconvenient (closely-held) truths' out in the open while steering clear of their bankrupt frameworks by volition.

My own sense cockney represents a culturally evolved and resilient kernel of anarchist ethos because of London's special place in history as a 'lost and found' basket of the 'Old World's' marginalized as well as England's rare ignominies against unorthodox (non-bureaucratic precis) innovators (the 'black boys' of old Europe - Roman, Vikings and Normans). Alas in it's native habitat the mentality is endangered - being overrun by yuppies and chavs (both wearing Burberry).

But I digress; in an information technology context we would call my Off-License transaction identity abstraction. It is decentral while yet being credible (admitting no arbitrary authority nor even needing one) to effect something that works *better* than uniform law. It will happen and will allow an astonishing variety Turing-completeness, which in turn offers enormous potential for automaticity the lifting of coercion in governance. It's nice to be your own boss *really.*

Incidentally this is why marginalized communities develop *familia* mechanisms of governance to maintain order in parallel political-economies (realities) when they are not admitted into (i.e. sanctioned from) the formal one. One does not need law to know the difference between right and wrong - and knowing the law often doesn't seem to make any difference to a Sovereign happily breaking it when circumstances demand; 'temporary suspending the gold standard indefinitely right through to special purpose vehicles that allowed the Federal Reserve to buy corporate bonds (illegally) during Covid. 

Those of who are self-sovereign and do not admit to any authority save God (or nature if you prefer) write and live 'good code' (with which to counterparty with the world) because we know what constitutes virtue. 'Let the hegemon's agents have the United States of America. We have God' is my response to Matt Damon's character in '[The Good Shepherd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbbxQqKXUIk)'. We don't do that kind of separation because...
