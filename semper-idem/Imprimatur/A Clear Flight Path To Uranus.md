## A Clear Flight Path To Uranus ##

Toilet paper makes about as much sense as paper cash money except that the former is much more hygienic to begin with and much more productive (or fertile - certainly it's closer to literal fertilizer than the 'bullshit' US dollar) at the end.  If you are going to use paper cash please understand that it has passed through many hands and you shouldn't use for anything much less wiping your arse.

In all seriousness however, the sheer quantity of energy we consume making and shipping toilet paper is approximately US $120 billion. There is as well the time spent unclogging drains and toilets. Earlier this year a flight from Toronto had to turn around because of a clogged toilet. Such is our age of the chaos. Imagine the hundreds of thousands of dollars of time, effort, fuel lost. 

Let's set back and understand the logic of the lack thereof. We start by planting many thousands trees each year, waiting years for them to grow to their full majestic heights. Then we take a plethora of noisy, dirty equipment out into that wilderness wreak havoc while we 'harvest' that wood. Then, we truck it vast distances and use various processes to pulverize bleach and fabricate a fine fabric which we then use after we go to the toilet. The insanity of it is enough to make you cry and the sheer magnitude of this habit on a global scale is calamitous. 

I don't take people who use toilet paper seriously. If you can get your hands dirty in the your own bathroom - which is just about the only place it is necessary (organic soil being generally harmless - even beneficial - to gut bacteria).

Consider too how absurd the use of the phrase 'to soil' meaning to make dirty when soil is about the most precious thing there is on this planet that isn't water (the universal cleaner).

Order one of [these](https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B08QHTVDM3?ref_=ppx_hzsearch_conn_dt_b_fed_asin_title_2). Or just use your hand in the shower after you take a dump. It's not complicated. Getting blood off your hands means dealing with your shit. If we can't stop killing trees to support idiotic business models and use cases that have become a universal aspect of how we live we are doomed. 

This is the kind of deeply embedded badly coded culture that can be rewritten through smart contracts and smart money. You can actually quantify the cost to the public and to the ecology and levy precisely the right incentive - even as social credit - to effect meaningful change. 

## Your Arse 'n' All ##

Climate change is the single greatest threat to humanity and there are some industries whose impact is negative to the individual, the commons and to creation. They exist because they generate revenue and have shareholders who aren't paying attention to anything except the yield on their 'investment' or who separate their *economic* life as a consumer or producer from their *political* life as a citizen - a kind of modern personality disorder. We need to live our lives as though they are a coherent whole versus a fragmented set of behaviours that brought together cannot be made sum positive. The self-sovereign individual is one who take responsibility for resolving global problems locally right where they live. This is ultimately what anarchism amounts to. It is not symbolically performative. Having the information we need, we vote with decision grounded in thought and then carried out with our own time and energy (that is the only form of money *we* truly recognize). The problem isn't cynicism. It is the abdication of our responsibility to challenge with real, small but meaningful action, along with apathy, indifference and fear. All we need is the courage to make a small decision then another and so forth. Rinse and repeat
