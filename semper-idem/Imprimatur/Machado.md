## Eat Shoots and Leaves

**Corny as it stands - FIX**



I’m not trying to be clever with the title (and yes, I’m with Strunk & White), but all I mean is that I don’t fuss much about food. You eat what’s given to you.

In my “vegetarian” days I spent a day learning to cast a fly rod—catching and releasing one trout after another—and figured we’d eat fish. No: I was served steak. So I ate it. You don’t complain when someone feeds you. The *sannyasin*—the renunciate—carries an empty bowl and is grateful for whatever fills it, even if it’s the dodgy pork that kills him.

Once in a while someone asks about my dietary preferences. My stock answer, since I go by *Shivam*, is: “Oh, you know—whatever. The usual yoga-people food.”

You become an asshole if you turn down cake or pizza at a party “on principle.” That’s not my brand of yoga.

When I do have agency, I stick to whole foods: fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, some fish, and the occasional bit of meat—usually a burger. I’ve always loved burgers and fries, and every time I see a UX “[hamburger menu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamburger_button#:~:text=The icon consists of three,up%20a%20normal-looking%20menu.)” I think of yoga elements. I love eggs too; I’d have kept chickens if it weren’t for the coyotes.

A Full English breakfast with lashings of hot, strong, sweet tea on the high road? Or a Tikka Masala? Absolutely—when I’m in England. These indulgences are the *spaces* in the L-shaped [*tevs*](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/call-me?blogcategory=Daily+Planet+(Toronto+Star))—habits—that feed my soul in ways that have nothing to do with micro- or macronutrients. They’re part of my heritage. Much as I enjoy eating alone, good company always makes breaking bread better. At home, we *always* eat at least one meal together.

I’m at my best when I limit refined carbohydrates, especially wheat. I don’t eat much bread, but I do love *good* French bread and pastry. I love hoppy IPA, and single-malt scotch is probably my favourite thing in the world next to coffee. Pick your spots and lose your religion. The path is made by walking.

Given my impatience with human stupidity, I choose to blend instead—with my Vitamix. Always whole foods, always liquid (water, coconut water, etc.—and yes, I feel a bit guilty about the coconuts). I don’t pretend to be perfect; I’m complex and forever falling short, but that’s the point. The machine’s been with me since 2010 and still runs like a charm.

Blending is something you develop a knack for. Spot a good recipe? Snap a photo and reverse-engineer it. (Credit to IQ Foods, one of my favourite Toronto lunch spots—try the Sparta Box and Kale Caesar, and don’t sub quinoa for rice.)

Here’s my alternate to the “Beet Surrender.” It’s called *Macha Do About Something* (Machado). My breakfast every other weekday for fifteen years. Start with the leafy, soft stuff, then pile on the hard ingredients to weigh it down:

### Machado

1 cup coconut water
 1 tbsp coconut oil
 1 tbsp chia (seed protein—don’t skip—emulsifier)
 Handful kale
 Handful spinach
 ½ lime
 1 stalk celery
 1 inch cucumber (preferably English)
 1 cup frozen or fresh pineapple or mango
 1 banana
 1 tsp matcha
 ½ inch fresh ginger
 1 tsp turmeric (optional)
