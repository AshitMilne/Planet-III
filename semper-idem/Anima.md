Sacred white cedar (its bark clads Haudenosaunee dwellings) at Milton's Crawford Lake grow right out of rock as if to express that primordial moment when life first appeared from stone.

## Introduction ##

In short, our purpose here is to examine what constitutes a human-centric system design imbued with a natural and organic intelligence that is efficient. We use the term 'emotional intelligence' or empathy broadly in street psychology to describe a 'good people' vibe. A deeper understanding is required if we are to enable contracts with this intelligence, which is why I frame it as Anima. This piece explores Anima and the elements that constitute it. The short answer is that through an anarchist lens, crime, especially premeditated murder (which of course includes war) is a health matter (i.e., not intelligent).

## Animus ##
>A heart that's full up like a landfill
A job that slowly kills you
Bruises that won't heal

>You look so tired, unhappy
Bring down the government
They don't, they don't speak for us
~ Radiohead (No Surprises)

To understand Anima, think of it as human intelligence—but without Animus (something absent in other fauna). Taking a via negativa approach, we may then approach human-centric design to create systems that work for all.

Machina before humanity was the world as an 'OK' Computer—God's idea. The discussion mudra was the unseen and unspoken intelligence that flowed freely in abundance: a force of nature to make life on this third stone satellite a reality. It was one with God, deeply embedded within, before the complexity of civilization began to arise. Anima is a human idea that separates and categorizes to understand and model the universe, but without a notional wholeness that is too complex and particulate to fully apprehend (Deus ex Machina). The risk, of course, is that the compelling model becomes the singular prism through which we see reality. Understanding that there is a (holy) ghost in the machine is critical.

I wonder at how precocious child Mary Shelley would have been—to have grown up under the guidance of such farsighted parents in a country as prosperous and relatively free as England. The daughter of anarchists William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft, of course, wrote *Frankenstein's Monster*', which can be summarized as follows: The corpse is not the sum of some ordinarily random parts assembled in an accustomed way in the manner of corporations (corps).

Now, London could be a dangerously bleak place in those times. The darker side of the freedom granted to Englishmen is that residents of some quarters were left to their own devices. Without the welfare state that emerged by the time I was born in an East London, a spiral of unfortunate circumstances might leave a person with few options but to (involuntarily) donate a heart perhaps; to some venture claiming research for some utilitarian 'greater good' (in the name of modern liberalism). The cruel calculus is hard to swallow but plausible. The incentive of a promised end is a slippery slope to justifying means that cannot and should not be countenanced in human-centric systems.

Living in a world where limbs and organs may now be safely removed and attached elsewhere, is it not at least plausible that in the world wrought by the East India Company and its kind of limited liability legal personhood that some bright spark might set up a 'single-person' corporation to maximize revenue by amputating perfectly healthy limbs (from perfectly healthy people who are not yet corpses) making them far more profitable beggars while providing a 'greater good' for 'private healthcare'? I don't say that such things happen. But in this world, it is, you must admit, at least plausible. You might even structure a corporation through Panama or the Caymans quite legally with some ingenuity. This is called 'clever' by the way, and it is somewhat different from (holistic) intelligence. With our penchant for making things complicated, we might call this 'Evil Artificial Intelligence'.

That's the crude arithmetic of quarterly results where the sum is greater than its parts. You don't want to believe that it happens, and I don't want to live in a world where I imagine someone executing such a business model. In my best of all worlds, those guilty of premeditated murder would be safely sequestered but free and given a way to good health, prosperity, and peace; not executed as retribution and then 'harvested' like some utility. Call it a humane form of device-enabled 'limited liability'. Granted, in the real world, needs must and pragmatism is relevant, but it's done arbitrarily with allowances for privileges and courtesies that an anarchist cannot abide, especially when the technology is available, and those of us who understand it can imagine an alternative version of reality.

The line from the Bard was "What a piece of work is man." Have you ever marveled at a tailor's work? It is something to cut and assemble material well—no small project if done with care so as not to waste fabric. Owning an off-the-shelf suit that fits as well as a Banana Republic makes them is enough of a flex for me. Having already bought it, I'll care for it and wear it for the practical thing a suit is.

Shelley's larger point was perhaps a different one: we already have machines to make men (and they are called mothers) so why go to the trouble of using weird science for the purpose? She presaged Nietzsche's more masculine version of the same message. We have replaced God, or rather put ourselves in his place: 'We'll take it from here. Thanks.' It was a salient argument in the age of autonomous engines (man-made machines) such as those weaving fabric in Blake's dark satanic mills and moving locomotive engines that had us suddenly realizing we had to account in our schedules for the variances between solar and clock time even in the short space between, say, London and Greenwich—now essentially the same place.

The point was this: 'How much abundance is enough?' And how particular and precise do you want to be about practical results and getting somewhere? At what point does 'research and development' become a flex? It is so absurd a question as to posit its own answer: The truth is that the cast was dyed in the wool and the wolf that came in from the cold became a friend and shepherd. The Lion, or as close as there was to one in a country already shorn of them for 10,000 years, already lay with lambs, and we in our Eden or rather New Jerusalem made it so. Is that not enough?

This conversation is about intelligence and technology—and not about how to get 'clever' with bad money governed poorly in the totality of our realm Regnum Dei. On the matter of technology, ask why authors centuries on from Mary Shelley print on paper that might still be trees.

As an anarchist, I dream of trees and even beautiful giant stones—I'll show you one in Algonquin that is miraculously huge—the size of a house and straddled with white quartz. I've read Edward Abbey and I don't need the Moab to understand him. Why all these maddening crowds with their incessant noise? These were questions that the transcendentalists were asking almost 200 years ago, and ones to which we are still trying to finesse an answer because everything is a priority.

Now I ask you, if I think I am privileged because I am not forced to surrender a kidney or lung, then what do you suppose I should think of a three-hour commute to what David Graeber considers a bullshit job? One that now offers little opportunity for personal growth and that has me wasting energy in pursuit of things I do not want. And what should I think of the vast majority who still continuously toil? It's not so much their pointless effort and time—that's theirs to use as they see fit—but the destruction they are manifesting through it to what we share. Even as I glimpse the prospect of a new approach to order—a way out of our morass—so many others are determined through inertia to stay in a groove driving an ever deeper scar into the planet. This is difficult to accept and live with.



## Paranoid Android ##
As we hive off into communities, male and female aspects of a society perform different roles. The feminine aspect of man (anima) is that which will listen and discuss to yoke community rather than immediately resort to force to aggrandize. The male aspect of the female (animus) meanwhile looks to keep and hold what has already been secured, fearful that coercion and force will one day leave offspring wanting lest the patriarch compromises through transactional behavior which structurally undermines the collective her matriarchy has nursed into being with care in the household. This is the inner tension in our collective with which we struggle as we simultaneously reconcile it with its reciprocal personality in the 'other'. These internal machinations are the paranoid android gripped by panic and fear or alternatively pride and prejudice as we encounter the 'alien us'. The contemplative seeks to overcome this negativity by emanating the positive and constructive elements of Anima—intelligence without which a personality risks being swept up by animus which represents emotion that is hostile or defensiveness.

Anima has five dimensions:

- A connection: a shared notion of what constitutes a high-fidelity commitment

- Empathy: an understanding of the things that makes the 'other' distinct as a stakeholder from oneself

- Clock time: a shared sense of what constitutes time (and critically what time is worth) in context and the objectives or milestones that a journey of shared time (roadmap) entails

- Memory: A shared ledger, if you will, which immutably expresses what is commonly and transparently known and accepted as truth

- Shared Purpose: We gravitate around a distilled outcome becoming from many one or *E Pluribus Unum*. This is our notional capital. Whatever the legal *ownership* of capital in a very real sense it is a shared utility

What makes this anarchy is that anima is sufficiently expressed in masculinity through the absence of coercive energy—either emotional or physical (violence) on a person. The fine line becomes nuanced in practice as incumbent participants in a polity resort to tactics required to achieve outcomes (electoral victory). Anima is essentially love without possessiveness; an abiding affection which neither wants nor needs anything. Love that does not require the 'other' to requite—nor even offer even negligible social credit. This removes paranoia and what is left is abstract identity (id) that contains both masculine and feminine aspects in a bespoke balance of androgyny. What this means is that we are not the same (which is to say we are not identical), but we are each of equivalent worth or value in Creation as a starting point for discussion. This notion is central to reconciliation and wholeness and demands the removal of arbitrary preference (i.e., bias).



## But Is It Yoga? ##
> अचिन्त्य भेदाभेद तत्त्व
Like the flower and the scent of summer
like the sun and shine
Well the truth may come in strange disguises
Send the message to your mind.
~ Kula Shaker (Tattva)

The word tattva in Sanskrit translates to "principle," "truth," or "essence." It refers to the fundamental reality or the essential nature of something. In Indian philosophy, tattva is used to describe foundational principles of existence or elements of the universe. In spiritual or philosophical contexts, tattva denotes the true nature of reality or a principle underlying existence, aiming to reveal deeper truths about self, life, and consciousness. That true nature radiates beauty.

In the Commons, our space for discussion or conversation, ugly is shorthand for dissonant—asymmetry too obvious to co-exist with order and something which requires attention. It is the opposite of 'beauty' which is alignment, reason or logic that is intuitively apprehended through the five dimensions of anima. The divination of truth to discern what is not beauty and so requires transformation is this process. This is the essential meaning of satyam, shivam, sundaram.

Generally speaking, one constructs by creating (building or erecting), this is done through open discussion that leads to fertile ideation through language that is free of arbitrary bias (censorship). One can be said to be allowed to express Lingam (लिङ्ग, literally mark or symbol). The realized linguistics or semantic perimeter make one who they are ('am-ness'). Hence semper idem (semantic perimeter of identity embodied).

Yoga is the practice of yoking self to creation through anima so that one encompasses masculine and feminine aspects of creation in behavior. In India, the Sannyasin was the contemplative who, after much deliberate introspection (a self-discussion in stillness without voice) and having seen through the pantomime of the Commons and its manufactured costumed fiction, would walk out of it to wander un-costumed (naked); performatively, their transparent nakedness was their costume: an unspoken satyagraha that spoke truth to civilization's rigidly cast power structures that could not emanate wholeness. They saw no way to bridge the chasm between the vast fraud without and what they themselves had seen within, and so they walked out.

That's the ideal. Now, civilization in its present mode is such that it encourages the opportunistic meme—merely the veneer of an idea and a path of least resistance to what is admittedly a version of what may be called 'the good life' (*Degen* rather than Scott and Helen Nearing's). Lucifer enlightens us and seeing an opportunity for indolence (efficiency) and licentiousness (procreation)—central rhetorical themes in what constitutes humanity, a melee ensues. Conferences are organized for the purpose. It is freedom untethered from responsibility and from accountability. This is the Last Man—a YOLO soft-nihilism before we settle into something more natural for the long run. Nietzsche's reset has us (and for that matter him) oscillate wildly into promiscuity before settling into a standard on what constitutes Regnum Dei. If not entirely wholesome, it's just dessert: dates with a few nuts as we examine the range of what constitutes the boundary of tolerable behavior, even it isn't accepted as comprehensively legitimate by some (kosher or ḥalāl).

## Self Sufficiency ##
Shiv, the patron of yogis however, is Sufi—self-sufficient in a metaphorical and mystical solitude as an archetype and as a platonic example of what it means to retire with meaning and intention: to be in one's own company as a palliative and practice like a John Galt or a Henry David Thoreau. To seek an understanding of self—and then bring it back to the world with Calling as God's gift. This is a practice to be cultivated as a component of life in the midst of culture.

To walk out on a problem entirely is irresponsible. As an alternative to walking away from the civilization of men is the opportunity to live and work within and yet in another paradigm. The ancient renunciates communed with nature giving up the world of men, but when you know that Creation itself is being assaulted by man, you cannot leave. You need to stand, deliver, and defend. One obeys laws and one works as much or as little as one wants. Never for money but for the love of the labor and with a view as to how carefully capital is expended. Whether yours or not—it was hard-earned. This is why an anarchist ultimately no longer sees the Sovereign, Hegemon and their corporate agents as legitimate. They are no longer creative but running to stand still on a dreadful treadmill.

One reason I left the practice of yoga (as it is known in the west) is precisely because I found it increasingly performative, aesthetic, and even, narcissistic. It is literally full of posers—and those naively mesmerized by the pose of one leading them on. In a sense, it had become a slick corporate product—an earnest caricature lacking in self-awareness.

My own feeling is that the extravagant knots of the original sannyasin were presented as a mocking satire—a frightful mirror inspired by Kali and shown to a messy and disturbing society as it tied itself in masochistic narcistic knots designed to draw attention and make an impression: the same problems were clear to yogis thousands of years ago as they are now; this is a subtlety lost on those bending themselves painfully into some extremely weird poses unnecessarily and those assisting them into torn hamstrings. That said, I came away with some clever ideas as I shifted to urban and wilderness protocols and methods—strategic and tactical. These tune awareness in the world much as introspection does in the quiet warm moments before dawn where I cultivated a seated vipassana practice—I needed to slow right down.

## The Sacred Feminine ##
My view of civilization is modeled with the broad spectrum of time in mind and with cues from nature at large. The rest of creation is ruthlessly efficient and without arbitrary rules geared towards making 'everyone happy all of the time'. The assumption is that everybody is already content, which is to say, they have what they are—there is no concept of property as such. Rules appear to be autonomously driven from an innate algorithm and seem based on logic: a calculus or a process that amounts to determining fitness for purpose. Division of labor is generally dictated by innate attributes. We apply these attributes or qualities through, for the purposes of this discussion, masculine and feminine aspects; all living things have masculine and feminine aspects. Some species have separate male and female plants, some species have male and female flowers on the same plant while the flowers of some have both masculine and feminine aspects within a flower. All species however in some way as an entity allow for both masculine and female aspects—respectively the stamen and the pistil (or carpel).

The masculine aspect in living things secures and projects while and the feminine nurtures and holds. With that as your basic idea in social science, grammar such as the use of gender and the person. In a transaction, a coming together that is necessary and dictated by circumstances, equivalence is sought not equality. If there were equality, there should be no transaction because everyone would have what they need. Instead, we're looking for an equivalence; a coincidence of needs. If you're looking for someone else's additive—the outcome of their creativity—something which you haven't but are in need of, one hopes you have something to offer that they need.

With these inherent aspects, a community will assign 'work'—the things required in order for life to persist in community: first by whoever is available and then optionally whoever does it particularly well—in that order. This is how life evolves—both in particular and in general. That is evolution.

Those who do a thing well are drawn, called or attracted to a creative potential by a masculine aspect much as a seed is carried on the wind to a destination. Should it land, it continues to create and growth occurs. It nurtures itself into being through a feminine aspect that implies the constancy of good process and regimen. Having reached full growth, it surrenders the need to be more. It is 'enough' and knows its. It is content to be in the world (and be kept in it as fate determines). What makes the sacred feminine? Without it there is no seed and nowhere for a seed to land and become some for fate to love back.

We see-saw through life but begin in Act I leaning in to discover and seed our calling. In Act II, having found it, we grow; finally in Act III, we are the fully potent and poised horizon and the path into the infinite future. We are the miracle of blood pulled from stone that came to think in metaphors of consciousness; as myths of bread and wine with which we were raised to become peaceful towers of still silent strength like redwood flowing redcurrant.
