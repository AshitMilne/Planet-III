The model of a sundial called Dial Square aims to reframe reality  by pivoting one's frame of reference from the Sovereign to the Sun (an objectively Platonic representation of Creation for modeling behaviour against since all other intelligence on earth operate on its signal). Coincidentally Dial Square was the name of the team whose members laboured at the house of manufacture (**dār aṣ-ṣināʿah** or دار الصناعة) for armaments: the Royal Arsenal.
