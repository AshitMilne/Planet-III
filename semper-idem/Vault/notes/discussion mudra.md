The gesture struck during daily seated contemplation functions much like a placebo, influencing outcomes when applied with deliberate intention—namely, alignment or yoking with the whole (yoga). In this corpus, the relevant mudra embodies the pursuit of equivalence: three extended fingers (≡) signify self-similarity to the totality of creation, while the thumb and forefinger joined in a loop represent the union of self and cosmos. Through these symbols, distilled in language and momentarily stilled, the contemplative engages with the commons of which they are a part. The mudra unites three aspects into a coherent whole, and its synchronicity is reflected in Western culture as the familiar “OK” gesture.
