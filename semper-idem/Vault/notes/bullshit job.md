**Bullshit jobs** (a term coined by David Graeber) are forms of employment that persist largely in large bureaucratized institutions (corporations, governments, universities) where the tasks performed are perceived by both workers and society as unnecessary, unproductive, or actively harmful. These jobs consume finite resources — time, energy, and material — in ways that appear increasingly untenable and unjustifiable. Beyond administrative roles, the category also extends to certain forms of production and services that offer only marginal real utility to individuals as consumers or citizens.
