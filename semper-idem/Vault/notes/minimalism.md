A philosophy of reducing the possession of things (whether it be objects or the modeled constructs of society - physical property, patents, copyright) which comes from the view that those possessions at some point become burdensome, impinging on both one's own quality of life and certainly those of other humans (these things having ultimately been drawn, or extracted, from a common source - creation and culture).
