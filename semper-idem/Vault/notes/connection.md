A bond or shared understanding of what constitutes a high-fidelity commitment. Connective tissue in the body serves as a metaphor for the structural and sustaining nature of such a bond. In contemporary usage, terms like “friend” or “connection” have often been diluted to indicate mere awareness of another’s presence, rather than a reliable or enduring relationship. For example, a LinkedIn connection or Facebook friend does not inherently reflect the continuity, depth, or fidelity of the relationship itself. They may not even be alive as neither platform has that degree of dynamism to adjust to changes in their real-world 'circumstances' (such as liveness).
