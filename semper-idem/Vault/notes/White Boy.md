Corporate but principled working, if not entirely ethically by the standard of say Christ or the Buddha, then well past what is legally required and to a standard of rigour unobtainable in general due to the discipline and methodological consistency required. Capable of applying capital with intelligence and rigour. Begrudging respect is accorded to these meritocratic hierarchies as by definition they are not democratic or passive (in fact they, like Black Boy are skeptical of democracy's efficacy). Arsenal, Bayern Munich, Google, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, Apple, Singapore, PRC, USSR, Ford (early), JFK, Steve Jobs, Rome. Besuited, conciliatory, VC-funded and also known as 'Titan Key'.
