The machinery of coercive will: a system animated by extraction, competition, and control rather than virtue. It is the engine through which Giants project powerâ€”delegating responsibility, automating obedience, and converting life into function. The _machina animus_ sustains order without wisdom, motion without meaning, and power without soul. This may be seen as competition for its own sake without long-term vision (exceeding a full generational cycle - 85 years).
