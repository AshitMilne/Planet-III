Jack is the archetype of the ordinary man hero in his mode. He is master of none upwardly mobile spirit who amounts to a hill of beans (traded for the storybook cow). A mound which penetrates the hoarded capital 'liberated' to lift all boats. He stalks the indolent giant - the self-satisfied and systemically privileged 'underutilized' yet overpaid. As Jack London is the self-sufficient outdoors' man quietly, contemplatively casting in the river and panning for prosperity. Quiet merchant/soldier of fortune he is the spirit of Dick Whittington made Lord Mayor of London on the strength of his wits. With a spirit teetering on aggro (animus) at the wrong wrought by man in the world he introverts to find the right leverage and fulcrum point to make some, any, impact.

The mythical lad, master of none is the upwardly mobile spirit who amounts to a hill of beans - a mound that lifts all boats. If he stalks it's the indolent giant. His is the prospect of a pearl from oyster, grist from the mill collected. Quietly casts in the river or pans for the prospect for prosperity. Quiet soldier of fortune is the discussive and adventurous spirit of Dick Whittington and Jack London. In a suite there is no female equivalence - this is archetype of the penitent soldier and priest serving a higher order than the household in civilization he serves sovereign duality (King and Queen) in the service of Creation.
