The mythical lad, master of none is the upwardly mobile spirit who amounts to a hill of beans - a mound that lifts all boats. If he stalks it's the indolent giant. His is the prospect of a pearl from oyster, grist from the mill collected. Quietly casts in the river or pans for the prospect for prosperity. Quiet soldier of fortune is the discussive and adventurous spirit of Dick Whittington and Jack London. In a suite there is no female equivalence - this is archetype of the penitent soldier and priest serving a higher order than the household in civilization he serves sovereign duality (King and Queen) in the service of Creation.
