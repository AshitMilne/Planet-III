Jack is the archetype of the ordinary man hero in his mode. He is master of none upwardly mobile spirit who amounts to a hill of beans (traded for the storybook cow). A mound which penetrates the hoarded capital 'liberated' to lift all boats. He stalks the indolent giant - the self-satisfied and systemically privileged 'underutilized' yet overpaid. As Jack London is the self-sufficient outdoors' man quietly, contemplatively casting in the river and panning for prosperity. Quiet merchant/soldier of fortune he is the spirit of Dick Whittington made Lord Mayor of London on the strength of his wits. With a spirit teetering on aggro (animus) at the wrong wrought by man in the world he introverts to find the right leverage and fulcrum point to make some, any, impact.
