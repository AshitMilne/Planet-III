A metaphor for the cultivation and distillation  of our best attributes. Time (hour) is spent in cultivating culture that is both personal and shared (our). While our time may run down, the glass is filled. Redcurrant is the spirit and legacy - the current that flows between parties in a transaction derived from the name of the city that (Corinth) which once served as conduit between rivals Sparta and Athens to seek equivalence to settle (reconcile) if not understand subjective value and develop appreciation and hence meaningful growth.
