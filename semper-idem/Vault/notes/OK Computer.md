**OK Computer** is the name of an important album by the band Radiohead. The _discussion mudra_ frames the "OK" gesture as the contemplative sits in meditation. _OK Computer_ can be read as another way of looking at intelligence â€” one that is not separate, but in union with the whole. The divine within feels yoked to the great Machine of the Universe (_Machina_): playful at times, but without animus, nor the fear of a paranoid "android." In symbolic terms one decides to be whole ('O') come what may what others choose is their decision. Maintaining wholeness requires us to draw a line and fork ('K'), that is, 'agree to disagree' for now and without animus.
