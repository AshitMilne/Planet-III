God is generally conceived as custodian, guardian, and protector. In complex societies, those still developing emotional self-restraint—often children or the morally inexperienced—are initially instructed in ethics through simple, observable cause-and-effect: good behavior is rewarded, bad behavior punished. Over time, this reinforces the principle that consistent ethical action produces predictable and preferable outcomes, both for the individual and for the collective. Crucially, most faith systems portray God as agnostic regarding the fortunes of any single individual, which allows for the establishment of objective standards of right and wrong. These standards, grounded in the predictable alignment of behavior and consequence, serve not merely as guidance for the self but as a framework that benefits the broader community.
