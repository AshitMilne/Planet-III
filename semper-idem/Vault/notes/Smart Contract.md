A self-executing program that encodes a precise set of conditional rules (“if X, then Y”), automatically enforcing outcomes when input values meet predefined criteria. This is how 'code' works in both software and statute. It establishes rules of behavior; however, unlike law, it executes deterministically without need for human enforcement. Good code is law. This makes rules apply uniformly, though the fairness of outcomes depends on the values and conditions chosen by the contract’s authors (bias). Smart contracts offer the possibility of enabling optimal outcomes through incentives in the 'not guilty but 'room for improvement' (correctional) category of behaviour (e.g. education, health, nutrition, and environment).
