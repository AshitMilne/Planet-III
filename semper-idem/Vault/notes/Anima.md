Is the jolly good ape aspect of humanity capable of the five dimensioned (emotional) intelligence blob (irregularly shaped whole) which constitutes love and reconciles it with the flora and fauna who though capable of love can imagine no future with or without it. Shorn of it he is is a self-centred Machina (without *Dei*) which like corporatism and cancer grows for growth's own sake. Those dimensions are emotional connection, empathy, clock time, memory and shared purpose.
