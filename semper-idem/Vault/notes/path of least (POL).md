The seemingly efficient, economical and exigent path taken by agents where time horizon is 'short' (less than a lifespan) and often exceedingly short (an election cycle or a 'quarter' defined by normal people as three months). The objective is to maximize a return denominated in fiat cash for a discreet set of stakeholders (voters and passive shareholders). Agents in this system are referred to as 'Pols'. POL may be done (White Boy) effectively but in any case it has minimal efficacy and seeks to hold and sustain existing structures as new ones are build.
