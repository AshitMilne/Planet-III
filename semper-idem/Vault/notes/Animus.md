The masculine aspect of the feminine. Traditionally modeled as spirited (exuberant) liveness to whereas Anima (mostly fauna) is the still, quiet and vital liveness (mostly flora). Animus grows hostile and defensive when liveness is threatened. It arises when rational and empathic masculine energy (generally responsible for defending a perimeter) fails to acknowledge objective truth and aims to secure its interests by defining an 'other'. The result is the debasement of beauty.
