A shared sense of what constitutes time in context and the objectives or milestones that a journey of shared time (roadmap) entails. Critically clock time allows for the derivation of time's value: A rate return (interest) for which work is swapped for leisure. This is profoundly subjective and never a function of traditional sovereign factors - the price of things. Naturally, time value may be impaired by a lack of objectivity in assessing optionality and one's perception of self-interest. The prevalence of concepts such as purchasing power parity imply a deep inequality in the way labour (effort) is priced and therefore valued globally given that clock time in the final analysis is a shared (common) experience. The model Dial Square aims to emphasize this by pivoting one's frame of reference to from the Sovereign to the Sun (an objectively Platonic representation of Creation for modeling behaviour against since all other intelligence on earth operate on its signal).
