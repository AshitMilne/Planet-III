## A

**Act III**
A third 'elder' phase of life forward-looking and committed to the future synthesizes prior reflection (a cycling of apprehension and introversion) to apply *semper idem* to societal evolution. It begins approximately at 60 and extends as a natural life and circumstances allow. While Acts I and II respectively have masculine and feminine bias. In Act III one seeks to regenerate the Commons and restore Creation.

**Anarchy**
An emergent and dynamic order, manifesting without centralized coordination through a network or ecology through identification of objective truth and aesthetic (minimal) purpose or utility in a specific context. It contrasts with chaos: a self-evident disorder and incongruity.

**Anima**
Is the jolly good ape aspect of humanity capable of the five dimensioned (emotional) intelligence blob (irregularly shaped whole) which constitutes love and reconciles it with the flora and fauna. Those dimensions are emotional connection, empathy, clock time, memory and shared purpose. Shorn of it man is a self-centred version of Machina (without *Dei*) - a paranoid android - expressing Animus which like corporatism and cancer grows for growth's own sake. 

**Animus
The masculine aspect of the feminine. Hostile and defensive it arises when rational and competent masculine energy that defends a perimeter is lost profoundly; this is the case when the Sovereign sounding ever more shrill and expressing paranoia and nativist instincts loses legitimacy. Pervasive in society when households are  bereft of men expressing feminine energy in the household, or absent altogether.

**Anthropocene**
The **Anthropocene** is our geological epoch. It is defined by the significant and lasting impact of human activity on Earth's geology, climate, and ecosystems. It confirms with finality that humanity is a dominant force of change on the planet, rivaling natural geological processes. God put us in the scene and it was not enough. We responded that we wanted to *feel* 'seen'.

**Anti-heritage**
 The accumulation of material or cultural preoccupations that degrade emotional, social, or environmental well-being; the erosion of relationships and institutions through overconsumption or neglect of ethical equilibrium.

**Atheism**
The refusal to admit a fundamental separation between a creator and Creation (Nature). Non-dualist traditions such as Taoism, Advaita Vedanta, and Buddhism operate within this frame, maintaining depth without recourse to a deity apart from the world. Pagan and animist systems, by contrast, may be read as entropic proliferations of deities arising from the tension between dualist and non-dualist worldviews.

------
## B

**Bitcoin**
A decentralized digital currency and transaction protocol that emerged in 2009, serving as a model for objective ordering of value and coordination beyond traditional sovereign-controlled monetary systems.

**Black Boy**
An underdog hard-line militant masculine charisma that intuitively demands insurgent rigour in the expression of  anarchist aesthetic and objectively high performing engines or systems regardless of the prospect for success. It is the anima turned animus in the modern world. Thomas Edward Lawrence, Josip Tito, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Che Guevera, Fidel Castro, Imran Khan, Yukio Mishima, Steve Jobs, Tottenham Hotspur, Sparta, Viking, Maori, Seminole, Apache, English (Jacobite *and* Roundhead) are exemplary. Ligne Claire, Bauhaus and Zen aesthetic are representative of the ethos. It demands that you be key - the POM - in response to Corporate White (collar) boy POL.

**Brute-force derivation**
A computational or systemic approach relying on exhaustive trial-and-error rather than coordinated, ethical, or principle-driven design. In the essay, this is contrasted with holistic, coordinated approaches to value and governance.

------
## C

**Centralization**
The centredness felt when decision-making returns to one's *legitimate* self-sovereign core from various core nodes. Or paradoxically the centralization of power at the sovereign and hegemonic core: the social science equivalent of a 'Black Hole' - where people need to be and are pulled towards inexorably away from those they are to represent. 

**Commons**
A structured set of shared and collectively owned resources, rules, and institutions through which individuals coexist and interact. Includes both societal governance structures and natural systems; the ethical anchor or stake for human coordination.

**Commonwealth**
Synonym for the Commons or commonweal. A structured set of shared resources, rules, and institutions through which individuals coexist and interact. Includes both societal governance structures and natural systems; the ethical anchor for human coordination. The addition of weal or wealth implies a currency of culture and its notional equivalent, money is in common use, cycling continuously through it.

**Compromise**
An imperfect settlement that splits the difference in a transaction for which a lack of transparency prevents a full accounting of due consideration. Maximum extraction of value is prevented. The Japanese character for middle is extended to represent this externalization that is negated into the commons and creation as loss. This is also the 'Ce qu'on voit et ce qu'on ne voit pas' (What is seen and What is Not Seen) of Frédéric Bastiat. In the virtual civil engineering of technology information this accumulates as 'technical' debt.

**Confederation**
In opposition to federalism, a confederation devolves power substantially from the dense gravitational centre of a capital to provincial, municipal or county governance. Decentralization manifests as multi-centredness and ultimately self-sovereignty (centredness) that aligns universally (in contrast to self-centredness) to partner(s), communities and Creation (or the ecology).

**Connection**
A shared notion of what constitutes a high-fidelity commitment.

**Consciousness**
A state of awareness tied to the idea of a universal or divine mind particularly in states of 'flow' wherein one is deeply immersed in the current - a manifestation that is both both instant and constant.

**Consensus**
 A collectively derived agreement or valuation that has legitimacy because it reflects coordination among participants, rather than merely imposed authority. In the essay, this extends to global or networked systems such as blockchain or collective human judgment.

**Coordination**
 The process of aligning individual actions, intentions, or contributions to produce a coherent and ethical outcome for the self, commons, or creation.

**Creation**
A synonym for the ecology or nature of ‘the environment,’ flowing beyond personal or sovereign boundaries. Used throughout these essays (semper idem) to highlight creative behavior by the self and commons as a means to align outcomes and address the tragedy of the commons.

**Credit**
A general sense of appreciation or gratitude felt by one who has been creative. Time well spent in hindsight is immeasurably satisfying. In the final analysis purely notional and felt rather than paid as token or even as compliment. However potential credit (i.e. a social debit) may be expressed as a token to actuate sound governance through incentivized behaviour.

------

## E

**Emergence**
 The appearance of patterns, value, or behavior from interactions among actors or systems, often unpredictable but manifesting as meaningful structures in society or nature.

**Entropy**
 Complexity or apparent chaos in human, societal, or systemic behavior. Not simply disorder, but the fragmentation that provides the substrate for new patterns, coordination, and creative opportunity.

------
## G

**Genesis**
 The starting point of coordinated renewal; the conceptual origin of Act III and the essay’s broader exploration of legitimacy, value, and ethical governance.

**Global Village**
 A term adapted from Marshall McLuhan, describing the networked state of human communication and awareness, where central narratives influence collective consciousness.

**God**
Generally God is framed as a deity: custodian, guardian and protector. Innocents (the young or those who have yet to learn the capacity for emotional self-restraint) are, in complex societies, are often at first instructed ethics in simple terms of good and bad behaviour being rewarded and punished by God to effect the desired behaviour.

------
# I

**Information Technology (IT)**
The systems, protocols, and networks facilitating data transmission, computation, and coordination among individuals and institutions. In the essay, IT is positioned as a catalyst for societal evolution and the emergence of legitimate value systems.

**Intelligence**
A form of holistic and intentional agency that is systemically aware. It operates objectively (truth) and manifests aesthetic appeal  (beauty). As such it commands universal legitimacy. It is the seeker's objective.

**Identity Stack**
 A layered conceptual model of identity including cryptographic (wallets, blockchain), semantic (domains, digital handles, semper idem), and human (personal, social) layers, used to anchor ethical and coordinated action in digital systems. Metaphorically this is Dial Square

------
## J
**Jack**
The mythical lad, master of none is the upwardly mobile spirit who amounts to a hill of beans - a mound that lifts all boats. If he stalks it's the indolent giant. His is the prospect of a pearl from oyster, grist from the mill collected. Quietly casts in the river or pans for the prospect for prosperity. Quiet soldier of fortune is the discussive and adventurous spirit of Dick Whittington and Jack London. In a suite there is no female equivalence - this is archetype of the penitent soldier and priest serving a higher order than the household in civilization he serves sovereign duality (King and Queen) in the service of Creation.

------
## L

**Legitimate**
That which lives up to a consensus of expectations held at large by those with agency, namely the sentient and is extended to that which has meets systemic expectations objectively measured and accounted for over time. Legitimacy may be jurisdictionally bounded however to the degree it is universally acknowledge it also commands relative prestige and acclaim. Compliance is irrelevant

**Le Prix**
 French for “The Price,” used in the essay to signify the genesis of legitimate global consensus—a valuation derived from coordinated, ethical interaction rather than brute-force imposition.

------
## M

**Money**
Notionally this is food or its caloric equivalents (shelter and clothing as required). It needs to be eaten, planted as seed or tended as cattle. It spoils if stockpiled or neglected: it will be subject to debasement or become available for illicit and/or unethical behaviour. Paper cash has this quality. Like crop and husbandry money requires a boundary in order to be well-governed. This boundary forms a Commons or a Sovereign jurisdiction and the 'crop's yield maybe seen as the 'risk-free' rate.

------
## N

**Nakamoto Consensus**
From Naka meaning middle and that which is derived from exchange of due consideration and Moto meaning base. Compromise to reach price settlement without transparency on innate value implies a loss to the coinbase (the finite reality of the planet). This technical debt is to be settled through the evolution monetary governance and eventually reconciled as fiscal rectitude. It is the matter constituting the recovery of MEV (Maximum Extractable Value) of priority transactions that meet a higher standard of rigour than merely the ability to pay for prioritization as we prove our stake to the finite reality of our planet. The path to consensus extends as a series of blocks into an *internal* horizon represented an infinitely divisible whole of extracted *alpha*.

------
## O

**Ordinateur / Ordination / Ordinance**
- *Ordinateur*: French term for “computer,” implying systemic calculation, coordination, and coherent outcome rather than brute-force processing.
- *Ordination*: Conferring of order, either in religious or systemic sense; the ethical structuring of collective action.
- *Ordinance*: A law or regulation enacted by a local authority to organize specific matters within a jurisdiction.

------
## R

**Ripple**
The metaphorical effect of individual or transactional action extending into the commons and creation, creating consequences beyond the immediate act.

**Regenerative Systems**
Systems designed to sustain, amplify, or restore value, rather than deplete resources or well-being, applying to economics, governance, and ecological contexts.

**Regnum Dei**
Latin for Kingdom of god encapsulates whole trifecta of governance (). Self-sovereign is common (regular) man, in (numbers) collective in the midst of *Dei* (God) which is diverse, equitable and inclusive in his realm to all. The Japanese character for country (国) illustrates the bounded reality of material transaction as the trifecta unite to manifest Regnum Dei

------
## S

**Semper Idem**
Latin for constant and unchanging this application of the term allows for the evolution of personality and character as one journeys through a saeculum - it is an abbreviation of *Semantic Perimeter of Identity Embodied*. In short this is identity abstraction or the encapsulation digitally of an identity's personality in letters in both sense.

**Stone Rose**
A metaphor for the layers of habits that are put or pat down by a person that  dictate behaviour. These are analogous to an archeological mound a tel (תל) or a tal (تَلّ) that denotes layers of human settlement. A culture rose, flowered and left its mark in stone. In the context of Semper Idem they  combine and mishpat (מִשְׁפָּט) mishtal (מִשְׁתָּל) to create a mound placed as a focal point for order, rule, law or justice (tal/tel) and so, culture if  tended but chaos if not - mishmash (in Yiddish מישמאַ)

**Synchronicity**
**Synchronicity** are meaningful coincidences that seem to defy causality, often perceived as signs or patterns; experiences where questions become affirmations of what is deeply known. These may be seen as fragments of our collective semantic perimeter *semper idem* as it pixelate for an instance into view through careful curious attention without followed by the still introspection within of a meditative practise as the symbols of our collective consciousness. It manifests as a religious or profoundly spiritual moment.

------

## V

**Via Negativa**
A method of problem-solving or improvement by the strategic removal of elements, specifically applied to governance, it would be to resolve the layering of constituents' needs that result from a subject's failure to distinguish their economic needs and wants from their responsibility to self, commons and ecology.

------

## Y

**Yoga / Yoga Element**
An awareness discovered through divination (introversion) of the true connection or yolk that binds the self to creation via humanity through creative behaviour (one's truth from utility - *Calling). 

------
## Z

**Zeitgeist**
The spirit or cultural mood of a particular period in history. A feeling shared across a great mass of people engaged in a broad social network. Ideas that may have been felt as synchronicity by one are shared so experienced by all
