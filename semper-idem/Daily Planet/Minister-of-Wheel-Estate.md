## Mercy Mercy Me

A little bit of Jagadish  जगदीश  (The Lord of Universe) and a little bit of Jagger dash (moves like Mick) is what *I'm* talking about - project [Juggernaut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juggernaut) is on officially on the roadmap with Sportsmobile's well-appointed Mercedes Sprinter the prime candidate. They have serious Lindy in the space, outfitting those who were tuned-in well enough to turn-up long enough to buy themselves some autonomy to live on their own terms since 1961. I'm approaching my Act III, the third stage of my life that has me saying 'Country Road, take me home to the where I belong' (but let's take the scenic route). Different people at different times of their life have their own approach to living a good life. We range outwards and explore and claim the world as youth (Act I ), settle into stable domesticity for to give back (Act II), then we consolidate to the kernel of our truth in Act III, continuing to live in *balance* wherein the line between giving and taking doesn't even need to be drawn because it's one and the same thing. The most valuable lesson I've learned over the course of almost sixty years (five-six to be precise) is how much we're owned by the things we own; with my kids grown and living their own lives, I've got considerable leeway to focus on myself entirely and this is just one tantalising vision.

Now, who know what unfolds over the next two years but it's nice to dream of things that *are* actually feasible - and this most certainly is. It saves me the need to pay property taxes; It gets me anywhere I want to go in the Western Hemisphere. Perhaps even park it aboard a freighter bound for Europe and Africa one day. Equipped with solar panels and a Starlink connection it has me in compact affordable comfort for a life blending recreation as well as collaboration and creative in the communities that are creating the Deus En Machin of SysGen. It also has me expressing the idea of sustainable balanced comfort aligning my own self-interests with those of the Commons and the ecology *in a way that appeals to me*.

Their Sprint Mercedes Benz anwd then transition to the new (I'm alright Jack) anarchic system design of self-preservation and actualisation amidst the beauty of Creation - far far from the madding crowds of zoo humans.

There are options available versus [Project Helios](https://transition-insight.com/research-%26-writing/f/project-helios?blogcategory=Daily+Planet+(Toronto+Star)) as I look to go full-blown Nomad and become the Minister of Wheel Estate. This is my baby Benz working the bends without getting dizzy with it. Home Shanty Home.

Both options - the Helios Boat and Jaganath are entirely plausible and it's coin flip that's equally enticing on both sides - it's either your head and your tail on the line so you'd best be good with either outcome. Install Starlink and solar panels and down the road do a biofuel conversion (it's a diesel) - not difficult. I'll be driving around smelling like Freedom 55 Fries making everyone behind me hungry...hmm - that looks tasty.

**Around The World in 8,000 Days**

I spoke to a fellow at [Sportsmobile](https://sportsmobile.com/models/mercedes-sprinter/). I've been eyeing them jealously for years (as well as teardrop trailers - that too might be an option - say behind a new Tacoma.



I've 'got' a company in London (import/export) and they might be able to get me a [RoRo ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roll-on/roll-off)berth on freighter ship - nice quiet passage across the Atlantic and learn about shipping logistics or time to read and just stare out into the horizon - maybe even lend a hand just to learn something. Let the good times roll. Who knows, with rapprochement maybe the Bering Straits become an option into the Old World.
