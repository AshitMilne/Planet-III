Above: My first passports. The clerks at the offices in London made sure to underscore the message - I was A Tel - reminding me that I was born a free man - Mister Patel, the Indian in a brave's New World to become hopefully *mishpat* (מִשְׁפָּט) and *tel* (תֵּל) and amount to something legitimate from London's New Ham - amidst a 2000 year-old mishmash (מִישמַאש) in turn both profane and profound since the Roman lay the first of a 'ton of stone' on the banks of the Thames (in Leytonstone). I might have forgetten myself in the coming chaos and turmoil of a tumultuous century's turning had those those clerks not be so judicious in reminding me I was 'a tel' carried from continent to continent to continent to, yet another continent, across three generations. Surely I had something to say about our modern interstitially complex reality.

>What befalls each man has been ordained in some way as conducive to his destiny. For we say that things *fall* to us as the masons too say that the huge squared stones in walls and pyramids *fall* into their places, adjusting themselves harmoniously to one another in a sort of structural unity

A Tel is a hint passed through time by the virtuous. It comes from the Arabic تلّ  and the Hebrew תֵּל, both meaning "mound." It is an artificial hill formed by layers of human effort over centuries. These mounds accumulate as older structures are built over and compressed; a literal stratification of history these tels are the civilizational stone roses. The slotted together aspects of a culture that may be deciphered by archeologists and anthropologist who want to understand what it is precisely that a people *valued* (and so, kept). The arteries leading up to these mounds carry the lifeblood or redcurrant that makes these mounds whatever they are. The distilled value deemed worth carrying home came from places and people we feel a connected. As  well in the end we're all on the same material plane and made up of those ordinary elements of the planet. 

In my mother tongue (the first language I learned as a young child) Gujarati, the word તેવ is pronounced 'tel' in the cockney I'd ingested on the streets of East and North London. It was slowly exorcised by years of elite education in England, India, Canada and Japan replaced with a vaguely academic Trans-Atlantic stream of an accent that drifts this way and that. In any case *tev* means habit.

We inhabit our bodies and in habit we manifest personality through action. What are we ourselves except a mound of habits to be carefully tended and curated by our constant gardener selves? Through the close inspection of introversion we tighten the interlocking pieces to build stable yet supple structures to the extent we mind and care for the matter which constitutes us. We keep what works, or perhaps what helps us cope for a while - a scaffold or a makeshift aspect, in time to be discarded for something more stable. This is how we make ourselves.

Who I am in words and action amounts to a semantic perimeter of identity embodied, a *semper idem* of culture. I am expressing the idea here using three aspects of modern culture that I had imported and become passionate about; that had come together in a bespoke fashion to define a perimeter; a porous and rewritable chalk circle constituted of three elements: *me, myself and I*. Those pieces were in place by the time Act I of my life was played out. As Act II starts to wind down in my approach to 60 I know 'where it's at' - it's wherever I am.

By 2008 I was coming together; beginning to understand my value even as it fell apart in the world. Feeling at home amidst friends found at work and in play even as the lines between those two things began to blur. The severed package that we present ourselves in order to fit in to the world. For me was starting to reconstitute to become wholesome. However, it played out first in peculiar ways as I tested the boundaries of my own inhibitions and inclinations to fully understand who I was to be. 

For a time the redcurrant stopped flowing for all of us, at least to some degree,  the lockdown - the stand-out moment of history (in all likelihood) of our lives. For me it was the moment my Tel settled to come together to find itself (yoga) or, one might say, meet itself - *miln* (मिलना). I began to surrender whatever was extraneous to become Ashit Milne: A planet come together.
