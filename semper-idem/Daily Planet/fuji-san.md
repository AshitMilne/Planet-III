**Nihon** 日本です 

In Japan it's said that a fool climbs Fuji-San twice. That's because at least from our own narrow perspective it is eternal whereas we're aren't - so why on earth have you spent so much time to make such an important pilgrimage and have so little presence to learn from it that you need to make the journey twice. The rare one who climbs it *three* times is asking too much from a sacred place granted an honorific. To keep that man's name a secret when he has so much time and money on such empty pursuits? He cannot be said to be content and can only be lost to himself. To be trapped so long on a path so empty is a kind of living death already — mercy lies in his awakening on the first climb.

There are no short cuts up the mountain (and you've already driven a good way up it - it's not as though you walked from Tokyo). We have all the time in the world — and if we live twice, that is to say stand tall as free men and not slaves, then the second life is a dreamscape compelling enough to make real in the time we spend upon the earth’s landscape during the first - our hours of wakefulness. Beneath the sun alone does the son also rise to the occasion as a salutation to the life-giving day.

I was granted a greater honorific still during my time in Japan: 先生 (sensei - teacher). I climbed it just the one time. The mountain unpassable in winter is climbed through the coolness of night during Japan's summer. The journey down is the harder one - at times through knee-deep black volcanic sand that crush the knees with each foot fall taking your leg into the soft yielding surface at times right to the groin. On your descent the blistering sun rises asking the question: 'Man, what did you learn that I should now beat down upon you with real heat this day having been up all night. Did you find what you were looking for. Quite the surprise as you turned that last step seeing that vending machine huh? Was it fully stocked? The generators make a bit of a racket don't they? So tell young man, what do you plan to do about such things?'  

I had the temerity to steal away from the summit with a stone. Walking the circumference of the crate at the top I came full circle then jumped in ten or twenty feet down to grab a look at research equipment deeper into the hole. The mountain is dormant last erupting in the 1700s and still regular emits steam. I picked up the stone and headed back to start my descent before it grew hotter. I expect to keep that stone until I die. 

I was on holiday from England with my mum visiting (I think for my Uncle's wedding in Kisumu). It would have been the end of my history. It was Africa 1971. You could do pretty much anything you wanted (outside of Rhodesia or the Republic of South Africa). You still can in much of Africa. It's often quite chaotic - even in relatively orderly Kenya. I had a fair few 'near misses'. After each of them everything feels like a bonus. As well I think my whole sense of what a 'risk' entails may be different from most peoples' - I gained a tolerance and appetite for it early. I would have gone down into (prehistoric natural) history - an impressive sheer 500 metre drop. Later at North London's Winchmore School I would be placed in House Scott (named for Robert Scott) - a more successfully suicidal adventurer who failed to make it to Antarctica in a case of desperately poor project management - in fact a total utter absence of it whatsoever would be more accurate. 

I was on holiday from England with my mum visiting my Grandfather in Kisumu. It would have been the end of my history - offered as an inadvertent human sacrifice to the blessed mountain. It was Africa, 1971 even now there are no barriers or other safety features keeping you danger - and I like that. Why should there be? You can see clearly what it is (unless you're two years old and just lollygagging like a toddler and running about excitedly because it's not London). you could do pretty much anything you wanted - you still can in much of Africa. It can be a chaotic place even in relatively well-governed Kenya - but as it anywhere it's people who are the real danger. Everything since then has seemed like a bit of a bonus since - as well the definition of 'risk management' - I gained a tolerance and appetite for it early. A decade later I was lucky enough to catch a glimpse of the volcano as our aircraft past it on the way back to London. It is something to behold. One of the most, if not the most spectacular things I'd ever seen - the pyramids we saw as we passed over Egypt looked like miniscule Lego constructs - paltry and pathetic in contrast - and to think of the misery inflicted to build them.

What I have learned in my time is that *time* is the only money worth spending well. How much you have is more or less down to good fortune and the quick wits of those about you when you're young and the wits you yourself develop - honed to a fine edge the closer to it you run; it's your mound (tal/tel).

As well time is best spent when you're not too worried about preserving it or spending too much of it earning a Pharaoh's coin - especially if that means 'roles and responsibilities' that even in some small measure perpetuates servitude and penury for others. That knowledge alone drawn up from the deep wells of the *tel* I put down - call it a philosophy, sets one apart from the rest amidst humanity's many-hued throng in their money-mad quest for 'retirement' and a delayed solace at long last; an all too short respite for the decrepit alienated from the children they neglected getting to their 'promised social contract. As I've matured the best risks I've taken involve confronting what civilization deems to be 'good' or 'of value'. Social Credit (such as it is - is the last great short trade left - it's ignorance -  and so scales to become that kind of evil that can't even say it has a 'plan or intention' - it's just pure and incoherent imbecility). It's the two-sided coin of woke Karen and her diesel-spouting Dodge Ram 3500 driving, assault rifle toting frenemy who ruined the internet. Drop it and run. It has by the far the best returns with virtually no downside. Humanity runs as far as way from you as possible as what they define as reasonable, normal and proper you call mediocre, unimaginative, dull, narrow and untested. You're 'lit' with [post-thymotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thumos) impulse and what they see someone 'running with fireworks and sharps' (and they're not wrong it has to be said) so they disperse. It's a gorgeous experience watching them scatter - they think *they're avoiding you* when really they did the heavy lifting of granting you freedom; pushing you out that difficult door (you are a *social* animal after all and it's hard to leave without them giving you a firm push).

**The End of History**

All of which brings me to Nietzsche, Fukuyama and 'prophecy' of rupture. Perhaps the most consequential book that I read in my early 20s was Francis Fukuyama's The End of History And The Last Man. The wonkish among us were giddy in anticipation of the peace dividend - most of all those of us in our early 20s and students of governance who relished being able to direct the heroes - the young - who would follow us as we created Fables of the Reconstruction - a reconstituting of the timeless and storied past so that they in their time and age might discern meaning and act with intention to do good now - and comprehensively so. The internet, at least as we now know it, hadn't arrived yet - it was 1989. But now, today, it seems we have a platform to create something which might have value with minimal cost to the commons and those of us with time on our hands as well as the means have begun to use it well or at least better than we did previously - to speak our truth.

Fukuyama (his name mean blessed mountain in Japanese) argued that liberalism had won the day for the world. History, told as the sequence of great moments when decades happen as a series of volatile instances would now come to an end and the incremental step-by-step long walk to freedom for all would begin. Democracy had prevailed and all would be sunshine and lightness hereon. Slowly perhaps but surely. Young and naive we were still avid 'liberal' democrats ensconced in our tidy little privileged corner of the world. We had drunk the philosophical Kool Aid -  our studies hadn't really even included Anarchist thought at all. Paint It Black was still just a song by the Rolling Stones lately conjuring up jarring images of Vietnam (which was making a televisual and cinematic comeback in those years). Fukuyama wasn't entirely wrong - of that much I have faith. Just early.

Conservative or Liberal? That was the preferred sex on the opposing side (the NDP were just Liberals in a hurry). Just a different favourite colour is all it amounted to. Sometimes literally. At model parliament, you looked across the aisle and checked out the Conservative chicks (if like me you sat as a Liberal) and then passed them messages that went across to them via the Speaker's chair. My brash mate sat next to me was sending notes via the pages to blondie in Cabinet. He suggested I go for her mate Blondie #2 (The pair of them were *totally* 'Western'). 'But we're bringing down the government tomorrow with a 'money bill' no-confidence vote' I argued. 'We'd be compromised - they'd think we're using them!'

In the end, Tory or Grit, we were all the same - the lucky few - being brought together to 'mix and mingle and maybe (who knows?) pair up for keeps' and 'do something'. We were all the same, pledging allegiance to Queen and Country. We believed in our institutions and when we said 'our country right or wrong' we meant that even if we were wrong, we were wrong *together* and would stick around to turn things right before Yanqi next door well and truly fucked it up for all time and for all people everywhere. 

As Canadian youngsters studying the Humanities at a good school we drew a sharp distinction between us and our uncouth and far too familiar neighbor. We chose them ahead of a adversary presenting a clear and present danger but that was about it. For they appeared then as they do now indiscriminate in their lack of prejudice. Pride was once something lions *had* versus a human emotion (hubris conflated to mean dignity) they could not possibly need to feel. But in the age of the Disney's Lion King it's anyone's guess who is proud and why - and lions won't ever have prides again (not in Gujarat, nor Africa, nor even on the shirts of England's footballers) by the time they are done. Hakuna Matata? Really? Yanqui was already beginning to look 'up all ends' even to us young ones back then. Rather than admit to the [Anthropocene ](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/a-sort-of-homecoming?blogcategory=Daily+Planet+(The+Star))they appear to just 'want to be seen' - through anthropomorphism no less. We are all left watching animated feature presentations on rectangular screens with ever more digital clarity looking for alternative notions of reality while the one Creation unfolds before our eyes in the real world disintegrates into the chaotic abyss of Hamburger and Tuna Helper that was once just macaroni. They went to town alright. And how. It's all 'Mickey Mouse' - just more naff bollocks that's ever more photo-realistic. Paint instead for me by hand a picture of a single apple - I spied one in a Vancouver gallery and I gazed at it for a long time - with incredulity and in pure wonderment. How prescient now does Orwell's Animal Farm seem? I recall reading it on the train to work one morning and thinking how bizarre and absurd the story seemed and now realize I hadn't even cast a thought at that moment about the inanity of the Disney and Barbie Princess stories I ingested with my daughters. Things of course are weirder now because in the casting of the 'live action' versions we're now arguing (sorry, debating) about the 'demographic' characteristics of the human (too brown but also too airbrushed to be Snow White). For pity's sake - at least she's not having deep and fully syntactical conversations with animals. Better the quiet communion of lamb and lion being offered - a tilt towards both reason and empathy - is something - a step forward.

**...And The Last Man**

*Beautiful snow* that's white? What other kind of snow is truly beautiful. But why be so literal. I once knew a 'beautiful white snow' ( 美雪 ) who was turned Moab brown in the summer sun. In the guise of Belle women are the Übermensch's first focus. Women die violently at the hands of the Last Man for no reason. Too often she has nowhere to turn - least of all the failed sovereign. If you say to me Commons before Creation, then I say,

*Woman, I can hardly express My mixed emotions at my thoughtlessness After all, I'm forever in your debt*

And woman, I will try to express My inner feelings and thankfulness For showing me the meaning of success ****

*~ John Lennon (Woman)*

**The Gift of Dear**

When the Übermensch orders, he fancies himself *beau* to *any* woman. Especially when he has both purse and age on his side of the table, *she and hers* break bread and eat at his expense (and he turns rogue at the first sign that opportunities for expressing the barest of such generosities diminish in these, the days of the now desperate Last Man).

Francis Fukuyama as I recall didn't delve too much into the significance of the *Last Man* in the context of Nietzsche's writing. Nietzsche had introduced the idea a century earlier with seismic impact on those who intellectually contemplate  the human experience (existentialism). Suffice it to say that the Last Man was he who climbed Fuji-San thrice or worse, cannot see the point in climbing it at all and so sends one of his subjects to do it for him (three times or as many as is required); or else it is the one who takes out a second (unpayable) mortgage to 'conquer' Everest and only gets halfway (to the top) before leaving his mortal coil completely (bereft of energy or even capable of another breath). Leaving humanity from the *front* (versus leading it forward from wherever he is) is the tell. He was bereft of any capacity to discern value and price for his time and no privilege nor courtesy is too large to be granted him. Indeed he takes it for granted - that is the meaning of the term divine providence. He is excess personified. He had no red lines and it isn't beneath him to ask for ritual humiliations from those who will never have his purse, tenure nor privilege (nor yet even want it). There are those would rather stand as themselves as they are and die with nothing than bow to the Last Man - for he has recourse to brute strength - short and nasty though his life may be at the end. The most profound humiliations have been felt by young men who have perished for having been born on 'his' land as subjects and then treated as objects in the quest for land and treasure, only to have their blood spilled while present in action, responsible and unaccountably uncounted for among the blessed. Why cry over spilt milk one might ask - whoever or whatever the mother? Better they had been *rōnin* ( 浪人) and masterless. We are all in any case adrift if we believe or make ourselves subject to the insanity of mechanisms gone rampant, and not instead sovereign in our own mind to rage against the machine with a primal scream that beseeches 'come together'.

For Nietzsche the Übermensch sees and follows The Last Man — which is to say, comes after him (in every sense) without being subject to his order, which amounts in the end to conveniences that extend the lifespan of a debased 'path of least resistance' — a culture of comfort, dilution, and inertia. It's a cancel culture that denies truth and beauty. The only response is tur and face and cancel it before it saps what is *vital* in you — your very life force — your pulse, strength, courage and vision. Power emanates from the word with force majeure — a natural legitimacy that gives it the capacity to stir men into action and at last end the ferocity of a natural world that wreaks havoc on those who do not read and will not understand. Knowing clearly the distinction between good and evil, the Übermensch are capable of drawing clear lines and conducting themselves in deed (act) and in deed (contract as written and processed words) that do not cross those red lines but draw finer ones still to make a point and send it home at last. They are masterless and self-sovereign. They do no favours for those with too much title, time, money, and too little sense — not the kind that becomes a penny dropped or a cent earned, but instead is *our* penny at long last urned for their keep. In the final analysis, the natural order demands a simple reality: that the relatively poor cannot be made to foot the bill indefinitely for the relatively rich even as a 'shared' externality — not for long can such an order be allowed to persist without consequence. 

**Project I'll Manage**

I walked the perimeter a decade ago of a pond named Walden near Concorde in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. I came home with a potential projectile having picked and pocketed a pretty brown sparkling quartz (above). I gave flight to that stone this summer, letting it loose to arc well and land a stone's throw away in my front yard there to lie forever. That's a lethal a real projectile as I may launch in *this world;* I'm a pacifist and it was thrown to make a *fine* but blunt point in written word on this plane. Other planes are not my business. I have given flight to paper planes in my time by basket load. It is Thoreau's words that I thoroughly absorbed. As for that 'bit of wet spit' in a deadbeat Yanqi hole? I would sooner die right here right now than see it again. I expect among the residents of nearby Concorde's town-houses are those who are completely ignorant of its significance so why should I give a God-damned care? Two words in particular - economy and ecology. Those two need to have transcendental flight - and be allowed to arc into the distant future with balance and well beyond the modest moments that span our lives.

There is only 'do' and there is no try. The burden of proof for those who 'try' is ever higher and the price they pay when they are tried and found wanting more while having too much already will be their heads. Love our stone (this *third* rock from an ordinary sun) - or leave it to dwell on another plane:

Are we etched in stone or just scratched in the sand Waiting for the waves to come and reclaim the land? Will the sun shine all sweetness and light Burn us to a cinder, our third stone satellite?

*This (Fuji-san) is no metric with which to take the measure of a mere man or even, mankind or manhood - anything of any man's in any sense, material or otherwise substantial (that has symbolic substance, i.e. meaning). No place is more sacred to me than this the [Stone Rose](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/1-square---the-stone?blogcategory=Regnum+Dei+-+1.+Dial+Square) and the [Dial ](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/3-dial---redcurrant?blogcategory=Regnum+Dei+-+1.+Dial+Square)manifested by Creation - where modern civilization's day begins and where it must first end. This place is beneath you - and beyond your capacity to comprehend but it carries me and mine west ( मेरा जूता है जापानी ).

** Where I am and where I live, my response is simple: I give my daughters 'my' property — making them freehold owners as they step into adulthood. They’ll be free — at least more than most — of the Last Man’s exploitation, the sovereign’s voracious agencies of ‘revenue,’ and Yanqui hegemony. They’ll have to share it, of course, like everything else — but it’s a harbour, and it’s theirs. They’re extraordinary kids. I don’t expect them to be rewarded for that — probably the opposite. Giants love to sniff out the special ones and squeeze them. There are no hiding places in their Instagram world. For me, generational wealth lives in my most precious currency: their time on Earth — and the purity of its mint, measured in agency. Maybe they’ll keep me on as caretaker — no longer caregiver. I’m still pretty useful. Otherwise? I’ll declare myself [*Minister of Wheel Estate*](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/project-jaganath---the-janus-jalopy?blogcategory=Daily+Planet+(The+Star)) and head for the highway. Call it propaganda of the property owner's so-called deed.

Postscript:  Lately, in reading an account of [Colin Ward](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colin_Ward)'s life, I'm moved by, the absurdity confronted by soldiers, including Ward himself, who whilst their country waged war against presumed tyranny (fascism) faced *real and impactful* censure (exile and jail) for speaking their mind and congregating to conduct conversation about the nature of liberty. No war waged in 'the West' seems to me so 'modern' (recent) and yet both post-modern and futile as the American Civil War. How much more recent and absurd would it have seemed to Ward and his thoughtful contemporaries. What must he have thought of Jesse Owens? Allowed to win a fair race in Munich and then return with his gold medal safely tucked away to violence and segregation in his 'native' America. Then later to be told to go to war against 'authoritarian' Germany or Japan.

I've been to Gettysburg and it plainly looks a scarred place - rutted and strewn with randomness. Neither allowed to flourish into meadow and then forest, nor yet rehabilitated - cultivated by an experimental co-operative's agriculture and workshops - a kibbutz might have been just the ticket. The nearby town is a superficially picturesque tourist destination made prosperous with kitsch but Harrisburg, the region's metropolitan hub is absolutely dire. If you could look upon a place and say 'that's purgatory' then Harrisburg/Gettysburg is it; and wasn't it just so recently broadcast across that country's entertainment division (party politics) as a stark choice between 'unhinged old and white' (Disney 'hell') and a 'captcha composite demographically perfect check-box' (Disney 'heaven')?

An anarchist will feel hemmed in by his resistance and refusal to affiliate with the ultimate insanity - being asked to inflict indiscriminate violence against men compelled to carry arms against him (it must have been super weird when the only difference *at all* was the colour of the uniform). You don't require a salary to defend yourself as you mind your own business in your own community. It follows then that you do not require a wage to live a just life in peace. If you do take a wage then it can only be a matter of time before paid to you're told to wage war to just earn your keep - and this is the inexorable slide towards corporatism. How far have we really come since Colin Ward lived and died in our thinking about the ability to think with discrimination even as our technology and understanding of architecture has evolved and impacted our ability to effect industry? I'm honestly moved by the courage and conviction of ordinary people who have come before me - anarchists - and feel reinforced in my decision to leave corporate 'life' (if you want to call it that). I got my wake-up call when losing access temporarily to my LinkedIn account left me unable to maintain traction in business. My response eventually was to delete the account altogether. That kind of dependency smacks of servitude. Federalism (decentralization) is not always self-evidently legitimate, but centralization that lacks legitimacy is, prima facie, neither credible nor truly human-centric. Nor in the long run even sustainable - efficient or productive.  It hasn't been a comfortable or easy transition — far from it. But it has been fruitful, constructive, and creative, ripening with optionality - and my own trial of Job - after which [attraction ](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/attraction?blogcategory=Peridot+(Illumination))amounts to the bliss at the end of a life lived satisfactorily well in the service of the planet and the manifestation of good upon it.
