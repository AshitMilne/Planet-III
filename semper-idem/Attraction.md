Artwork: The Self-Preservation Society. The avatars of Vishnu (Ram and Krsna) *sustain.* They preserve what they have so that they may manifest Brahma (creation) and thence Shiva (transmutation). That is to say evolve or adapt to circumstances so that  they may continue to sustain and create in a state of constant transmutation (evolution) - cycling for eternity ([Nataraja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nataraja))

But there's no danger It's a professional career Though it could be arranged With just a word in Mister Churchill's ear

**Have You Got Yourself An Occupation?**

Those lyrics above speak to the simplistic exhortations of a sovereign to the idealism of young men (and now women) to sacrifice their lives for or a an idea whilst the privileged find away to dodge that same responsiblity. War is the random and wanton destruction of the 'other' and only one word suffices for it - crime.* Only people (one or more humans) decide to go to war by executing it by others who are guilty of 'following orders' or 'doing their job' at the very least against others who are doing precisely the same thing. This is '[mechanical turk](https://www.mturk.com/) for dummies' (anyone naive, lazy or psychopathic) to take a job that entails randomly killing or censoring the 'other' then delegates to another the task of carrying out the task with 'patriotism' as the justification. This is why Churchill called it the *last* refuge of a scoundrel. It is the simplistic who pay the price with their life. My own anarchist perspective is that all existing contracts including the so-called *default* currency are null and void. I believe there would be consensus on this in what I consider my philosophical leadership**

The story is told in scripture with Abraham's offering of his son Isaac as a literal sacrifice. This denotes a moment of surrender to a power greater than he. Abraham's wisdom is made narrow and clear with an orthodoxy. His is the Lord's hand on earth and he is unwilling to surrender his son to a life of penury and enslavement. He would sooner sacrifice him to creation than deliver him to powers that will make of him a 'mechanical turk' of their bidding. This is the orthodoxy and surrender to the creation (Brahma) that will sustain (Vishnu) us - but not to a Caesar - and this is anarchy. In the story, a ram appears and its sacrifice denotes the transmutation of energy and matter by creation into sustenance (the moveable feast of nomadic husbandry). Contrast this to the transmutation offered by the Caesar of the dollar and its promise of paper wage for life - it is literally a 'promissory note' - wrung from a tree that would have been better left in the ground. Now you understand the meaning of faith and have no need for religion nor hope for a better future because it's to be found here and now with your bare hands and the insight which guides them. Transition.

Rigidity and orthodoxy imply a basic understanding of truths that cannot be translated clearly to another nor fully appreciated unless it already *understood*. These basic facts are for children - so that as adults they do not need interpretation. This is what we mean by direct experience and the notion that religious experiences come in many varieties. All is for naught if we *compromise* and are through an accumulation of such compromises made *compliant* to structures and institutions who are not concomitant to those basic truths (or promises). If the foundational constitutional frameworks are not adhered to in practice then the edifice constructed atop is always profoundly flawed. Code requires orthodox adherence. No line of code can be written, assembled and compiled in any language and to be processed in different ways towards different outcomes for different people. The results will be incoherent and inchoate (as they are today).

**The Bullshit Job**

A degree of agility and mobility together with an acute capacity for divination through introspection is demanded of those who will respond to their circumstances and the story of Job is one that illustrates this.

Job is a wealthy and upright man who lives in the land of Uz. He is described as “blameless” and “upright,” one who “fears God and shuns evil.” He has a large family, wealth, and is pious. God praises Job’s righteousness. But Satan (literally “the Accuser” in Hebrew) challenges God: he argues that Job is only faithful because his life is comfortable. If he were to suffer, Satan says, he would curse God.

God permits Satan to test Job—first by destroying all his possessions and children, and then, when Job remains faithful, by afflicting him with painful sores. Job, now childless, destitute, and diseased, sits on an ash heap, scraping his sores with broken pottery. Implicit here is that the comfort many of us enjoy cannot objectively be justified while so many both in our own countries and certainly those further afield suffer deep destitution. Job's complacency and insensitivity is the cause of his trials. Whatever work he has done may have been done with fertile seed (bull) planted in soil (*good seasoned* shit) but too much is still lost in the whole for it to be truly righteous and so it is taken from him before he has developed the conscience to understand his plight and ultimately, his sins. 'Job' security is a fraud whose aim is to make one perpetually insecure. This is what David Graeber [meant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs).

There is satisfaction in creative endeavor to be found in the 'bullshit job' until there isn't - that point when the ROI (return on investment) becomes negligible for you. Then it is time to be self-sovereign (Roi) and realize that one has enough to make more of himself in pursuit of a greater good with partnership and community that is aligned on values.This is attraction and is not to be confused with temptation or of being led into trespass by it. This is *good* work and we have no need to sever our soul from the work that is demanded of us by taking in return something of no value merely because others arbitrarily assign it through fiat as though they were God; so that there is ever less toil and ever more flow and no need of toll, tax nor even tithe*** as the greater hourglass fills our (collective) glass without the empty promises and apologies of a Santa nor the accusations of Satan - who amount to the same thing; a giant, Goliath or Leviathan who led us into temptation.

*The very notion of 'war crimes' is absurd from an anarchist perspective. War may be in fact waged successfully against failing institutions and their compromised agents without resort to violence or even civil resistance. It requires a degree of creativity - art is never for its own sake and the soldier always pays a price but only to himself hence the need for the radical creative to sustain self whilst immersed in vocation.
