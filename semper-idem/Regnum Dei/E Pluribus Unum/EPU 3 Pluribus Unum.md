**The** **Nature** **of Money - Milk and Honey**

*All I have is all I need enough for love but not for greed yeah.*

*I was younger once this guy came to me told me about all the honey out there.*

*He said "Honey gold jewels money women wine cars that shine."*

*I don't know what he was talking about but I think I had an idea.*

~ Kula Shaker, *'Hey Dude'*

The Winklevoss Twins were once roundly mocked on Social Media for essentially making this[ point](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-a-hedge-against-elon-musk-mining-asteroid-gold-say-winklevoss-twins) - Honey (and its ilk) is scarcer than gold and therefore far more valuable - easier to understand if you’re hungry after Lent or Ramzan. 

I’ve spent a lot of time in the wilderness - I’m even certified as an Outdoor Guide by [Toronto’s Humber College](https://humber.ca/) trained by [Dave Arama](https://wscsurvivalschool.com/about/) (also famed 'Survivorman' [Les Stroud’s](https://www.lesstroud.ca/) mentor).

You quickly find out the difference between ‘price’ and ‘value’ in the backcountry and there’s also the old adage: three minutes before you need a breath, three days before you need a drink and three months before you need to eat - these are our most urgent priorities and we have long since solved them to the point at which we ignore them - from both the perspective of our personal well-being (the heavily process, chemical-laden matter we call food and drink) and from the perspective of the commons (the quality of our planet’s air, water and soil - from which food *should* come).

A decade ago during the final ‘examination’ for the outdoor wilderness course - a component of the program I mentioned Dave sent me into the Ontario backcountry on a wet cold October Saturday armed with a lighter, knife, bottle and a granola bar. With the rain teeming I scrambled to build a shelter before dark set in, squeezing moisture from moss and snacking on winterberries. It was hypothermia inducing weather but in motion with an agenda and a sense of purpose I found flow and smiled the whole time. I got a solo shelter together - nothing taller than I could sit up in and dry enough to get a fire going (I processed the firewood as much as possible, keeping it dry under pines while I gathered branches and bows for the shelter. I was absolutely shattered (exhausted) by the end of the day and faced a prospect of getting ‘pseudo’ sleep while I kept the fire going - masochistically most of us were paired but I’ve got a penchant for sailing close to the wind so I went solo - and had no partner to take turns watching the fire.

When Dave blew his horn to call us back to base the next morning I trudged out cold, hungry but content. Similarly I’ve gone out into the backcountry to endure nights of -35 celsius. You get a good sense of the difference between price and value very quickly - you’d swap your $800 Garmin watch for a night’s worth of twigs (the sort any suburbanite might leave at the end of his driveway in his green bin) in a snap if it came to it. To this day, and forever a pile of timber left at the end of a driveway will catch my eye - ‘that's worth $150 even here in the city - should I throw it in the back of my truck for our woodstove?’ I think.

I intuit that we moderns need greater awareness and appreciation of the opportunities and optionality around us - not be too quick to refuse refuse. And instead to refuse what passes for ‘treasure’ but is in fact superfluous. How many watches or handbags do you really need? We’ve gone *way beyond*:

*Oh we're way beyond our means*

*To buy these crazy things*

*Oh we're wasting our whole lives*

The simplest story of man in nature is perhaps Crusoe’s an example provided by Mark Spitznagel in [The Dao of Capital](https://www.amazon.ca/Dao-Capital-Austrian-Investing-Distorted/dp/111834703X/ref=sr_1_1?crid=27710DPZJ3EDZ&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.9bJ9khRdEzGh993QCdWK4h2sLpP00vi-viEu24u397XGyu0g2R06DW6wPqf5fIHE1VYFidm2cJZEsXgGQoNaArUdaqXjKU92eyGEpw_Nu_aI9zzzUCZVfIztr6uc0V5gx98sjsHTJ4atKEpuNcKBX5Zg3d5euVsKGa0ukmjphts1cdRsxx62ZHWTQU17o_ERokrRnEft-1J5XPbJzA2syxyKXcaWYUXAYEhCQcVRWEDaie_X9sleQsznvMvB531SKl3HJybJa5r38oWQ6Qgp3cIbVebUVIXHms92POkp1Nk.jm-0gEtoHMhoLBipIQ5lMtPP5F0GOLbf10i16NBHkPY&dib_tag=se&keywords=dao+of+capital&qid=1714265736&sprefix=dao+of+capital%2Caps%2C1315&sr=8-1). He forgoes the opportunity to fish and consume his catch today - starving a little instead - to build his boat and nets. Taking materials sparsely from his surroundings he creates something that yields comfort - a larger catch and more time to attend to other needs and ultimately the time to perhaps even contemplate. He has at the ready *the information* and a clear *signal* concerning what he needs and wants - what he values (the future value of being fed with greater ease) and the price he’s willing to (labour, time and brief pang of hunger) - *success* is the outcome in this time-honoured tale for which we needed a marshmallow [experiment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanford_marshmallow_experiment) to remind us of what we already know but too often forget

**Losing My Religion**

Why do we forget? TLDR: Because, it’s a very very Mad World, *Civilization,* and we have lost our signal and information. If you will permit, we have lost our God in the Machine or as Nietzsche has it *“God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him”*

In my imagination Crusoe discovered ecstasy building that shelter - the contentment of flow - a pursuit of happiness instantly created and continuously iterated in an agile flow of work - a never ending story of [Austrian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_school_of_economics) bliss where price always equals value. Because in our Web2 civilization today Crusoe is delivering empty homes, superfluous airports and bridges leading to nowhere to people dying from diseases of civilization - all the while people go homeless and hungry. In a Kafkaesque Black Mirror interpretation of Crusoe, I imagine him becoming so enamoured by his ingenuity that he continues senselessly building boats and nets eventually starving, with hysterical maniacal laughter, to death.

The promise of proof of stake is that it yokes the creator of value to the marketplace with clear signals that are represented in tokens that instantiate the magic of creativity and labour because they express yield - the stake for securing the network and then can be re-staked in communities, enterprises etc., for incremental yield. They give us permissionless, censorship-resistant, signals that is free of biases in the aggregate because they are utterly transparent - and point us to clearly where our capital can best be applied. This is a big deal.

So in answer to answer the question - what is money. I’ll save you the usual technical dross your search engine trots out and simply say this - it is a thing of value derived from nothing save the earth that fuels our muscles and feeds our spirit of creativity. In a modern online world we are able to scale this through a token which expresses the value we have created in an open free marketplace where an objective price can be determined so that supply more truly meets demand.

What is at stake and why does value break from price - First slowly and then all at once?
