**Contract**: The word has the sense of wheel or weal. It is how we, together (con~) cover ground (*tract*) to create wealth (a sum positive outcome for *both* parties - i.e. you and them. Hence the terms wealth and commonwealth.  In practical terms there are only two parties to a contract as far as your concerned. Of course in a liberal society we are free to abstain from contracts that do not appeal to us. The social contract however is accepted *implicitly* by (being alive - i.e. possessing the quality of liveness.



## Introduction

Part Two of *E Pluribus Unum* explores the concept of contract — and in particular, the social contract, which governs how we agree to behave in society. Part One, *Leviathan*, examined what passes for leadership in Western liberal democracies: how it is constituted, bounded, and positioned relative to the rest of the world. One unspoken mythology of Western democracy is that of meritocracy: institutions, it is claimed, operate within a system (capitalism) that automatically elevates the most capable individuals, in a free marketplace of ideas rigorously examined by attentive citizens.

In practice, this myth collides with the reality of governing large, complex nation-states. Processes must appear to function consistently, yet scale and complexity make this impossible. Rules and strictures are imposed at considerable cost to ensure disciplined procedural oversight, while allowances and exceptions are made to keep governance manageable — often undermining that very oversight. Compounding this is the imperative to maintain the prestige, esteem and security of officeholders and institutions in a competitive, adversarial global context. All of this serves to cast leadership as a coddled coterie rather than a representative meritocracy.

The result is a growing separation — a psychic distancing — between the state (Leviathan) and those it governs, producing an inevitable erosion of trust and legitimacy. Surveys, such as those by Pew Research Center, show that public confidence in both public and private institutions have steadily declined since the 1950s. While few doubt the good intentions of senior leaders in public or private institutions, systemic compromises and fiduciary pressures create mounting tension on the social contract — the implicit agreement about how we treat each other. Broken promises, particularly the idea of upward mobility — that diligence, curiosity, and creativity will be rewarded — highlight the contract’s fragility.

Yet there is an adaptive mechanism built into society: a kind of dialectic in pluralist systems that allows innovation to persist outside incumbent structures. New ideas can then diffuse into the social contract, enabling governance to evolve — or, as I suggested in Part One, devolve — outward from the Leviathan to the periphery, ultimately empowering individuals to govern themselves without permanent intermediaries.

This second part explores the qualities of a well-functioning contract: one that executes processes consistently, predictably, and without bias. Such contracts — particularly those capable of operating autonomously, on-chain, or algorithmically — may be central to the devolution of governance to the self-sovereign individual. As well they are critical to the long-term resilience of human civilization sustainably on our planet as the transparency with privacy and security enabled allow optimal outcomes: In technical terms, maximal extractable (legitimate and credible) value.



## Cum (Together)

Contracts are created as a utility (an instrument or tool) to allow complex civilizations to flourish. The word is derived from Latin. The prefix *con~* from *cum* (meaning together) while the term tract is from *trahere* meaning to draw, pull, or drag. So a contract is a means for us to come together to gain traction and manifest a sum positive result for mutual benefit: Something greater than that we would have achieved separately. Therefore contracts are creative and in a practical sense they facilitate generation, productivity or if you will, fertility; you will note the synchronicity drawn from the primal reality of that moment when life itself begins. This *seminal* moment of creation extends into the rest of our lives and it's why the discovery of one's *Calling* is important; turning us from the anguished scream of repressed identity to instead a discovery of our primal selves so that we may manifest productive outcomes. 

Legal contracts are drawn up to stipulate explicit terms: “If this, then that.” The structure is conditional, encoding obligations that arise from envisioned opportunities, which in turn enable the enjoyment of rights to a share of a fruitful outcome. There is a clearly defined cause and effect between obligation and right with the former preceding and resulting in another. So much for explicitly defined contracts.

As a component of what we might comprehensively denote as *social contract*, in addition to the explicit legal contracts we are obligated to observe there are social norms. These introduce the idea of what we have implicitly agreed to be acceptable but not necessarily a matter of law. These are matters of good behaviour, decorum and taste. They also introduce areas where discretion may be applied; for example in a familiar context amongst people with the capacity of providing informed *consent*: for example, parents serving alcohol alongside meals to people (their children) who may technically be minors under the law. Another example is where a degree of convenience or ease is determined to be necessary. Perquisites or comforts provided as a component of one's responsibilities in a 'leadership' role (in government or at a firm) are another example; Here the informed consent of those ultimately responsible for shouldering the burden (taxpayer, consumer or shareholder) is implicitly assumed. Common sense suggests a degree of responsibility and deference to a sense of fairness and equity be exercised by officers lest credibility be compromised. Ideally transparency ensures that stakeholder expectations are addressed, while a degree of self-restraint or discipline is also (naturally) expected from those shouldering substantial responsibilities.





## Supervision (Transparency)

While children require supervision we expect 

Think of a society, not as complex as ours but still orderly and structured. Those of our indigenous communities. Or the first societies which formed; ones with *implicit* rules rather than the explicit ones we have today (i.e. law). Obligations, except for the very young *always* precede rights. For example you cannot claim a *rightful* share of gathered and hunted victual without first having participated and asserted *some* talent to express the feeling that you want to belong to a community. Invariably you will introspect on what that may be as you scan your immediate surroundings to find a gap that needs to be filled; a reality or truth which needs to be adjusted to align better with what your nascent community requires as it seeks comfort. In economy, you are *obligated* to stake a investment in order to affect a *return* on investment. In our health and welfare we are obligated to invest time, effort and care in relative youth to reap the return of a relatively comfortable old age.

Now we may hallucinate in a moment of inconsiderateness, perhaps prompted by fear or a sense of scarcity, to model our reality differently. It seems trite and simplistic for example but simply using the term 'rights and obligations', placing the effect before the cause may have a profound and rippling impact on how we govern our relationships and transactions with one another. However, nor are rights and obligations enjoyed *simultaneously*. 





**HERE** - ties back to transactions and privacy (where oversight is not warranted - i.e. no warrants dispensed)









But this *if/then* logic extends far beyond the legal domain. It describes how all systems — social, ecological, moral — maintain coherence. Laws formalize it through enforcement; conscience enacts it through awareness. In both cases, the “if” represents the initiation of will or circumstance, while the “then” measures alignment with justice, balance, or integrity.

When conscience is excluded, contracts become purely transactional — efficient but blind. When conscience is included, *if/then* acquires moral depth:
 If an act sustains creation, then it is lawful in a higher sense;
 If it harms, then it violates the deeper contract that binds being itself.

Thus, the true contract is not only between persons or states but between human will and the order of life — between action and consequence, cause and meaning.



The implication for a *social* contract is that through our connectedness to each other we lift and ride with each other out of the world in its bare original state to derive comfort* (which means 'together strong' if you analyse the term for its etymology in Latin). we need to live well enough to pursuit contentment; whatever fate allows in our circumstances based on what we are afforded by each other. Intuitively this should make sense to you as you look around. The heating, lighting, the building you are in keep you comfortable and you are unlikely to have been self-sufficient in the provisioning of these. As well throughout history, the breakdown of legitimacy or the social contract is made evident by the failure of basic processes or utilities long taken for granted: electrical failures and water shortages for example. As well the definition of a necessity appears to fail basic rational tests in a flawed system design; the panic over toilet paper remains a luxury for a large number on the planet - and one which is increasingly indefensible from an ecological perspective. These are red flags for those who assess security and risk at macro level. From a systemic (holistic) perspective it is actually insane. The intuitive loss of legitimacy suffered by the system (sovereign) is reflected by Krishnamurti:

>It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. 
>
>~ Krishnamurti



Social Contracts have two interrelated components: the law provides and and social norms.; one . The other one, implicit, are social norms.







The Indian philosopher and ethicist also intimated that observation needs to precede judgement

and judgement and that the entire experience of life was an education from the first minute to the last. We are apt to fall in line, guided by what passes for 'social norms'. Contemplatives however speak of a beginner's mind and understand that we *filter* information through a set of assumptions and perspectives. Thought may be rational but it is always *subjective*.

**HERE**

 If we understand that we have but one perspective with which to think, we continue to observe and gather data to see how others operate 









As well they are agreements, not necessarily of course explicit, specifying outcomes contingent on *obligations*. We will often talk about 'right and obligations' as though they arrive together.

Now, it doesn't help that in our discourse the term *rights* literally precedes the term *obligation*. But at the minimum we seem to believe that both



Similarly in software development, we have have conditions which need to be met in lines of code





While the equator provides an objectively geocentric frame of reference in the physical world between north and south, it is the psychological axes that dominate our geopolitical realities and this has been true since the very beginning of civilization. Now, recency and personal biases affects our opinions. For example my own biases has it run through Greenwich (London). However in reality

 there's only one axis that counts. It runs up the Nile from Lake Victoria and the nearby Rift Valley where human civilization began up the Nile to the first civilization to scale to enormous complexity

Our reality pulsates and radiates from the these axes.  and one dominates completely. oThe first 



 Paper contracts such as the US dollar have been used in the west since the invention of papyrus in ancient Egypt over 3,000 years ago. In the east 

It is a token of trust in the government that creates it and administers its distribution throughout what's known as the US Dollar Regime. What this means is that it is not just the currency of the United States but rather purports to be a utility for a world based on a set of values; two primarily: democracy and capitalism.





On it you will find the word 'In God We Trust'c



Those are sacred words - so too ‘In God *We* Trust'. There is no ‘US’ in ‘We’ and gazing back from the azure God only sees us.

Money is a technology and *we* (all of us together) need to evolve with leadership that acknowledges our oneness by building a platform that fosters global partnership and collaboration; any competition is ultimately about our better angels constantly seeking a new personal best.

*Transparency* will separate a technology that does harm from one that does good. Only a technology that draws a strand that traces from the ‘one’ (our private key) to ‘many’ (our public key) securely will work. America must lead because the 'spec' is on the 'specie'. And brevity being the soul of wit, America gets points for style - but really needs to pick up the pace on delivery and execution. As things stand, however, the global hegemon is on ground that still tremors from the echoes of the Great Financial Crisis of 2008

**The giant that walks around you seeing through your petty lives?**

I found David Graeber’s [Debt](https://www.amazon.ca/Debt-Updated-Expanded-First-Years/dp/1612194192/ref=sr_1_1?crid=M88AXWO6CZ00&dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.34MX0YDZZuKCoeWBbYLUZijFli7S1i0v1CtE8HSDy1ZZLThc5uMukpva8WEKnAWeP7A3SYaFRkPeSEWfvGDftYJ0RNhNQeOsWiFaL-3PN8RNq-QeGOC1nRqKbD1lxhpgJpHmCZsIV6xfgXN0P6ZfPh-yjlNfYm7rDG2w_sFgb3hHSDwJB-DEq17yP7O0Riii8z8Mp_weju_XauNPPM88I3kuK_aj81qVir2v1fZ3Mj8.XGlm0Mo30mIC_wNGCMxquKIP55vy6zCJT1ZXejkBTa8&dib_tag=se&keywords=debt+the+first+5000+years&qid=1716773287&sprefix=debt+the%2Caps%2C215&sr=8-1), which I referenced [earlier](https://transition-insight.com/f/the-promise-of-blockchain-and-ai-the-prehistoric-ledger) in the aftermath of the Great Financial Crisis and the emergence of Satoshi Nakamoto’s [whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf); it circulated widely  in the emergent crypto community as a backgrounder on the nature ‘money’ - which we use daily without much thought. 

I came to it because weirdly the question wasn’t addressed in my otherwise comprehensive education - which included an excellent Master’s in International Political Economy. We should never get so far before understanding money - because our misconceptions about it lie at the heart of our problems in life and our complacency on the subject of money is so comprehensive as to seem induced - almost *‘manufactured’.*

The problems stemming from our ignorance compounds in our lives and in our society over time to the point at which the subject becomes a matter of public discourse. The  first, lazy and instinctive thought is “conspiracy!” But as Kahneman points out even elite undergrads struggle with this basic arithmetic: 

*A bat and a ball together cost $1.10. The bat costs $1.00 more than the ball. How much does the ball cost?*

If this has the best of us stumped because we don’t stop to think. Then how much more thought is required to understand something so arithmetically complex as the global monetary system before we stop jumping to the stupid conclusion that periodic systemic money fails are caused by hoarding globalists?

It’s a tragic tradition that points a finger at those living by the tenets of a simple idea: *time is valuable and needs to be priced - and paid for*. It’s a problem that we grapple with in our oldest ethical traditions often badly because we struggle with defining the *objective* point at which this legitimate idea of lending capital becomes *usury* - a sin but one too loosely defined.

But in a world of accelerating disparity between ‘Have’ and ‘Haven’t’, Pulp’s [anthem](https://open.spotify.com/track/0NWnWSkFT6p01JDgmQxbTT) from which the subtitle above comes, strikes an angry chord and induces righteous anger in the souls of common people. They look to the sovereign for answers.

Leviathan in turn seeks to [grab](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_6102#:~:text=Executive Order 6102 required all,in 2023) per troy ounce.) what we in tech call a ‘honey pot’. If it fails it does so only because the honey is spread widely - *decentralized*.

The tragedy of course is when the honeypot is squarely in your sites because of 2,000 years of wretched [hate](https://www.worldjewishcongress.org/en/news/a-third-of-nazis-war-effort-funded-with-money-stolen-from-jews-study-finds) -  and centralized. 

But Pulp’s anthem resounds with optimism in end - if we can rouse ourselves to the insights required to make a transition to something new:

*“I spy the chance*

*To change the world”*

**All Structures are Unstable**

Stable architectures are secured by multiple struts distributed widely - bridges, arches, buildings - they avoid single points of failure. Cross-disciplinarity helps with the examination of the problem and we have an internet that resembles a dilapidated unstable building with all the appearances of security and privacy - one rife with opportunities for exploitation. *Only murder in the building*.







This grows ever more problematic as the complexity (the macro social graph) of our global economy - the degree to which we interact with each other and those around the globe grows ever more complex. It is a game theoretical architectural problem that permits a classical prisoner’s dilemma - wherein each party acts in their self-interest but without the transparency required to synthesize from it an outcome that is optimal for the whole.

Writ large, starting with the hegemon and then cascading outwards towards the periphery on a global macro scale we have a circumstance that enables personal gain for people or institutions - corporates or sovereigns - or rather those of their ‘civil officers’ (arguably neither civil nor deserving rank). That possess privileged access to what we call ‘Production’ in tech (essentially the real world).
