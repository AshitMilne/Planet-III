**The Good Life**

This site is about the transition we need to make in information technology and it may seem strange that I draw so much on ethical, moral and spiritual themes. To some extent that’s novelty - the tech conversation  is generally about enabling efficiency. But in any tech conversation I’ve ever been a part of, say the implementation of a new feature, the first question we ask is ‘why’? The whole point of making that transition to a human-centric internet is fundamentally about living and working in an online space that is safe for humanity; that doesn’t just mean that it’s keep us from the obvious dangers of exploitation but also the slow-bleed injuries that snipe at our time (the fundamental currency of value)  - spam is an example. Nobody benefits from ‘efficient spam’. Whoever sends it doesn’t think of it as spam - but you do. So *why* is it sent? Because it benefits one and not the other. We need to move to an online reality where transactional reality is imbued with incentives to align the interests of all parties involved in the transaction.

How tech reconciles this need is fundamentally a moral, ethical, and even spiritual imperative - one that really hasn’t been fully explored in the context of how crypto currencies play a role; fundamentally the internet is a place where ideas flow between people - that our individual behaviour online aligns with the aggregate interests of the whole. We need a currency that takes the broadest, most objective measure of productive behaviour and incentivizes this. Productivity or *utility* to ourselves and to the world is the basic premise of ethics and protestantism does not have a monopoly on this idea - it’s one for example shared in monist (non-dualist) traditions of the east; the tradition of yoga is a cultivation of the oneness - do you not hear the echo of that idea in the phrase ‘E Pluribus Unum’? All of the moral and ethical objectives of corporate life come down to ensuring that people can pursue happiness - and that really comes down to one thing: Do they feel productive. When we have utility, we have a sense of purpose and meaning. We need money that incentives objectively productive behaviour - that behaviour which is seen as productive by one and by all - this is the good life.

**Yogi One Can I Be**

*It is no measure of health to be well adjusted to a profoundly sick society. ~ Krishnamurthy*

In 2008 at Downward Dog I endeavoured to cultivate vision (drishti) with a third eye as my third daughter, also Drishti was busy being born; years earlier when I was first drawn to the ‘Ashtanga Vinyasa’ tradition (ultimately, not really my long-term bag), because it appealed to my non-stop sense of motion and power, when all I really needed was *stillness*; I blogged about my practice under the name ‘Yogi One Can I Be’; which implied that awareness is fundamental to a *rebel* cause - but the *nom de plume* implied a *nom de paix rather than a nom de guerre.* We are looking for a framework that provides so much wholesome value that it is self-evidently futile and self-destructive for anyone to attack it - as a matter of fact, they’d rather switch than fight. The idea was to ascetically check-in to *society* rather than check-out as sannyasins typically do; to continue to live as a householder within a profoundly sick society and chart a course of behaviour that is *actively constructive in relation to it and through that behaviour set an example to be followed as a schelling point.*

Central to doing this is an understanding of value. In our last conversation we discussed how value is derived;  it’s a labour of love - the combination of creativity and labour to generate product - literally it is the productive behaviour of Robinson Crusoe versus non-productive behaviour of his Black Mirror version I imagine in the previous piece; the first finds comfort in conformance to the commons, taking only what he needs to yield comfort. The other leaves a trail of wanton destruction. Crusoe is in flow - aware and aligned to his environment while Black Mirror Crusoe is a prisoner of his dilemma - serving his self-interest, insane and incapable of reading the abundantly transparent signals coming to him directly from his environment. Too caught up by the incessant noise in his head, he toils a death march to his doom.

I recall a conversation on Larry King’s show following the Indian Ocean Tsunami - a [cataclysm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Indian_Ocean_earthquake_and_tsunami) that took nearly a quarter of a million lives; it centred on the ethical question of why ‘God visits such calamities on us.’ I recall too that far fewer wild creatures perished - they were switched to their environment. Meanwhile too many of us lacked that signal - driven to distraction by the boredom of industrial tourism or directionless urgency foisted upon us; I suggest we’ve each of us become a Black Mirror version of best selves,  and that while God has graced us with everything we need to flourish in this world, we no longer pay heed.

In a Vipassana meditation audiobook I downloaded off itunes (again, around that fateful time in 2008 when the money broke), [Jack Kornfield](https://jackkornfield.com/) tells a joke about a pious fellow who waits for God’s deliverance from a flood until finally drowning on his rooftop; upon meeting him in heaven the man asks ‘why did you forsake me?’ God replies, ‘Yeah, well, I sent boats, helicopters…I’m kinda confused myself to be honest - but make yourself at home.’.

Doing nothing at all regularly and consistently is one of the most productive things you can do - something I do every morning for twenty minutes; there is so much evidence on the value of contemplation that I don’t know why schools don’t start their day with it - to paraphrase Steve Jobs, we’d be a better world if we’d spent some time in an ashram

And if Jack is too boomer pedestrian for you try my fellow Generation Xers, Public Enemy on for size:

What we need is awareness, we can't get careless, 

You say what is this?

My beloved lets get down to business,

Mental self defensive fitness,

~ Public Enemy, ‘Fight the Power’

It’s important to remember that a seated practice is just that - a practice to cultivate *mental self-defensive fitness*. To quote another pedestrian boomer, Eckhart Tolle:

It is a means to cultivate a state of consciousness that can then be brought into your everyday life. The purpose is not to become good at sitting still. The purpose is to become more conscious in every moment of your life.

That cultivation of stillness wherein we *slow down* - starting with our breath -  keeps us from falling for the army of profiteers and their marketers - the hoard of Black Mirror Crusoes, our alter egos, who have made too much dross and now shill it as fast as they can. Their missiles - missives without value - travel at light speed exacting a heavy price on our wallets and our souls; sociopaths with the keys to your private domain - all that information they’ve hoarded about you gives them the precise coordinates for a precision strike. They know when to hit you with the right notification or advert, mesmerizing you into giving them what they want - your time and your money; they walk right through your front door with a view to a kill - ‘I just made a killing’ they boast with neither the irony nor shame of those completely lacking in self-awareness. Sadly ironic however is that elsewhere markets - even some for the basic necessities of life go unmet. 

**Primal Scream**

Patience is a virtue. The prime virtue perhaps - it is a prerequisite and basis for *productivity*. The first order is to sit and wait until you have an answer for the Loaded question: ‘Just what is it that you want to do?’ More typically we just ‘fall in’ with the crowd or what we’re told. But our collective productivity will be sub-optimal and our individual reconciliation with a world we have become alienated from will be incomplete until each of us has taken the time to sit in stillness and rediscover our gift to the world - the thing - the stream of consciousness - that puts us in *flow.* That tribute of a tributary that joins with a Nile instead of denial. It is a primal scream whose answer emanates from the sound of silence. When we answer, we find our [calling](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/careers/gen-z-plumbers-and-construction-workers-are-making-bluecollar-cool-0c386274?mod=hp_lead_pos8) and shun the Black Mirror money-go-round of bullshit (mostly admin) college debt with bullshit money from a bullshit job.

It's no good praying to the powers that be

'Cause they won't shake the roots of the money tree

No good praying to the pristine alters

Waiting for the blessing with Holy water

They like the same old wealth in the same old hands

Means the same old people stay old people stay in command

~ The Style Council, *Money-Go-Round*

Awareness is the foundation of a tactical self-defence system and the primary means of subduing an enemy without fighting or even carrying a weapon (in Krav Maga we learn to secure ourselves - de-escalate and disarm and never carry a weapon better done with both arms free - it is. Sun Tzu’s stratagem of the sheathed sword. Better still is to avoid dark alleys of Web2 and travel in broad daylight with bare arms (without bearing arms) on Web3 

I came across Tolle’s book ‘A New Earth', while I was busy cultivating my own yoga practice (and my skills in delivering software as a Project Manager at IBM Global Services). He talked about our need, as a species, to evolve in order to survive and his admonition to bring awareness to our lives is critical. We don’t do this enough and it has become a rich vein of topic in behavioural economics which explores how our psychological vulnerabilities can be preyed upon by. 

I downloaded the audiobook narrated by the author himself from itunes and listened to it dozens of times. Tolle argues that our species is at a turning point - and our key to surviving and flourishing in the new millennia is alignment of our private and public interests. He references Advaita Vedanta, a thread of Sanatan Dharma that draws no distinctions between the divine and creation - a monist ideal where self seeks alignment with the whole. I was in contemplation of the idea, again on the street where the matriarch of the political and economic philosophy, the idea of a decentralized currency was entering our vocabulary.

**Awareness yields Optionality**

Embrace the macro awareness of discovering and following your life’s purpose - that thing you do - and they will beat a path to your door and wealth ensues. Embrace the micro awareness of wakeful alertness in your day and you keep the spirit snipers at bay. Pay attention as you walk or drive through life for opportunities - problems that need a fix. Through both we yield benefit for both the self and commons - by feeding David (our better angel) and felling Goliath (the aggregate of the devil inside us all). Third eye blind, we live only semi-charmed kinds of lives and so Goliath thrives and the pyramid on our bills remains unfinished; the foundation has been laid but there’s no point: *E pluribus, unum, inperfectum*

Now imagine a mechanism that drives constructive behaviour through financial incentive in our technology and you understand the power of proof of stake crypto. As humans - we have no voice, no lobby, no union, nor chamber (save the echo chamber). Proof of stake gives us one that is self-actualizes autonomously by transparently identifying productive agency. 

**Thank you for your patience in these Unprecented Times**

To understand what a big deal this is - it's a first - in 10,000 years we need to assess both where we are now and how we got here - through a cycle called the Saeculum that reverberates through history - particularly the Anglo-American Saeculum - Pax Britannica and Pax Americana are in, reality a continuance. 

These are unprecedented times and they potentially yield a fundamental change in the way history marches. (Yes, I know how it sounds - insane).
