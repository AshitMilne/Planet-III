Artwork: Infinitely divisible: The paradox of a path into an infinite horizon of possibilities within a *bounded* reality resulting in balance. It's not addition by subtraction. Nor does it multiply like a growth.



## Introduction

If intelligence — expressed as Anima — is the blueprint for legitimacy (and what is more legitimately reasonable and beautiful than our ecology and its bounded animus?) then *capital* is its vector in the material world for humanity to replicate the order perceived in the natural world. It is the current which flows as the distilled codification of trust, the manifestation of collective purpose, and the medium through which creativity, labor, and cooperation transform potential into realized abundance without needless toil and spin. Without it we will incur the wrath of our ecology as its animus becomes ever more unbounded. The materialist's hubris is that nature may be tamed and that we may live in a utopia for eternity *literally* with data modeled with science bought by shredded trees they call cash; their 4,000 year-old technology for contracts. Self-styled titans, they are Leviathan. Better instead we embrace our fate than submit to their whims. Better to govern ourselves and live life on our own terms to find truth and beauty.

**HERE**

Our money as it stands is unsound. Specifically it is a utility for Leviathan to perpetuate a prosperity for its sphere of influence and it is used to deliver a form of consumption-oriented hedonistic satiety; it is a salve and a mechanism for coping with a deeper underlying problem - a lack of meaning because we cannot or will not use our time to find and follow our *Calling* - that thing we would do of value to ourself and to the world if we did not need money. The enormous issue at hand is that this coping mechanism comes at the expense of our ecology. The only response to this mounting crisis that many can muster is to clamour for their government to take action while they continue to live in ways that are utterly unsustainable and balk at adjustments they themselves are required to make.

for misapplied through sub-optimal decisions at the individual and sovereign level mirroring the failure of intelligence. The ultimate reflection of this is our admiration for the dragons who hoard and flaunt it: This is destructive, extractive, and ultimately unsustainable in Creation. Worse, it's in bad taste and soon enough everyone despises those with objectively bad taste because it a tell that you're corrupt and so lacking in self-awareness that you wear it openly.

Applied well, *any* money becomes the signal through which self-sovereign individuals and communities (including their aggregation as nation states) coordinate, flourish, and align with the emergent order of life itself. Temptation, fear and panic being real aspects of human animus, our money demands that we assure our obligations to each other, the Commons and Creation are met before rights may be afforded. Good money allows for this.

***E Pluribus Unum*** extends the conversation we began in *Sin Qua Non* to discuss the qualities of good money (capital) which does exactly that. This first piece, entitled *Generation Ex Infinitum* lays out an incumbent default operating system running without overarching governance; supporting transactional activity continuously to support self-interest. However, without a comprehensive social contract, an unwritten and seemingly autonomously *manufactured* consensus extracts from the planet indefinitely. This too without any meaningful satisfaction for either individuals nor sovereign states who feel intuitively that they are engaged in a race to the bottom. However, it is a mode which isn't obviously or at least imminently catastrophic. Which is to say, people active in this framework appear to be neither *particularly* happy or unhappy in their pursuit of meaning; could be worse’ is our default balm for each other.

>Is it getting better
Or do you feel the same?
Will it make it easier on you now 
You got someone to blame? 
~ U2 (One)



*E Pluribus Unum* - From one, many. From *within* one world we are capable of apprehending the infinite with our faculties - our minds and bodies. As finite as our planet is we have an extraordinary capacity for productivity on it. The matter at hand is whether we see our potential and use it well or squander it; engorging in the instant gratification of constant consumerism. 

Whatever anyone else chooses to do, you yourself have the capacity to decide for yourself what you want and need in your life; this is the power of autonomy: Start by closely governing what (and who) we bring into our lives, we deliberately and carefully curate every thing, person and moment of our life. Then crucially we grasp the beauty of our ecology and recognize is as our common ground; it is ours as much as anyone's.

Our ancient ancestors took from ecology to eke out comfort before *property* was modeled by civilization. Yet our First Nations in the Americas manifested civilization and continued it into the modern era; it was something much more than bare subsistence and without *any* formal notion of property. I imagine them facing the elements with determination, and not the animus of aggrandizement; simply a conviction to continue *their* way.

We took from our ecology to survive; stone and lumber for shelter and for tools to grow, create or hunt. Once comfort was safely brought home the active posture, the barest of  natural ***animus*** was exercised with awareness and without trespass before  settling back into anima. What had hardened for the hunt and for the quest was now set loose - sinew, breath and gaze eased and lengthened while voice quietened. In stillness and quietude something was learned within of what had passed. Knowing looks and wry smiles are all that told around a hearth still held whose flames danced all to calm slumber so to awaken with the sun once more in the morning.

It was the incursion of settlers and the conquest of territory that saw Indigenous peoples rise up with *animus* — not a hatred born initially of cruelty, but the final act of defending a way of life whose harmony was being broken. For the newcomers, land was a thing to be owned, measured, fenced, and transacted; to the First Peoples, it was a living relation, indivisible from self, spirit, and survival.

The first settlers into the so-called New World were followed by legions of interlopers who staked claim to “rights” that were nonsensical to the Indian mind. How could one person claim dominion over a river that sustains all, or fence a meadow that the elk had known longer than any man? The very grammar of European law — title, deed, inheritance — presumed scarcity and possession, where Indigenous law assumed reciprocity and stewardship.

So *animus* was inevitable: it was the clash between cosmologies. One saw territory; the other saw relationship. One wrote contracts in ink; the other wrote continuity in ceremony. When settlers claimed to “discover” lands already inhabited and to impose systems of ownership alien to the people who lived there, they shattered a balance older than any empire could comprehend.

And yet, that same *animus* — the spirit of resistance — became a testament to survival. It was not merely opposition to colonization but an affirmation of life itself: a refusal to be written out of the story of creation. This is the energy that anarchism seeks to harness as we look past a sovereign and hegemon and towards the ecology it even now continues to tear away at.

When serious peaceful Anarchists seek to offer alternatives they have been summarily canceled. David Graeber was targeted and persecuted in the aftermath of the great financial crisis: A serious intellectual losing his position and tenure at Yale without any explanation, forced into exile in London may be a short term kluge but it's not a good look in the long run for any regime which seeks to lead the world as a champion of thought, democracy and liberalism. And so we learn from our mentors and pivot when the opportunity arises to grasp the autonomy which frees us decisively from institutional dependence and the Leviathan's coercive screw.



## Leviathan

>Beauty — and all the values that derive from beauty — are not measured and evaluated in of the dollar.
>~ Rachel Carson

Every sovereign has an approximately defined operating elite. Call this the *Sovereign's* semper idem formed through a social graph of those who have connected over time and shown some capacity for competence, commitment and service; all those contained within it are 'read-in' to the extent they are trusted by the collective and require access to the data. The agenda for this cohort largely deals with managing the affairs of state in either public or private institutions; a business which deals largely with negotiating a 'split the difference' compromise between their household self-interests and the interests of the state and its people. 

The sovereign semper idem is analogous to Thomas Hobbes' Leviathan and is generally made up of giants (those who may or may not have personal wealth, but do at least have access to capital, connections and a market place for favours). Within the incumbency wealth, fame and high-office is the measure of success. This framework is replicated in regimes across earth in both time and space regardless of their founding mythologies. These measure of self-interest are accumulated as due consideration in a quest to serve civil society (the commons). The negotiation however has not until relatively recently included the ecology. While many in the regime sincerely advocate on behalf of the environment's protection and restoration, it sits *alongside* and not ahead of various other 'priorities' - electoral success, security and order in civil society, stable profits and jobs, and relative prestige.

This sovereign semper idem constantly 'assesses' the terrain beyond its perimeter for threats and opportunities which amount to the same thing: 'managing' people who are spirited, passionate, charismatic and capable; who have oversized potential for influence but remain at the periphery (deliberately at lower levels of the administrative apparatus) or outside of the regime entirely (i.e the pipeline for leadership) because they dissent; they object not so much to the underlying value system but to the operating system and structural resistance to the innovation and evolution.

>The world is my country, all mankind are my brethren, and to do good is my religion.
>~ Thomas Paine

The term 'enemies foreign and domestic' paints a stark picture of protagonist and antagonist: of those loyal to the sovereign arrayed against those who are working with adversaries to undermine it.  The reality is considerably more nuanced and complicated. The 20th century's most profound legacy was the speed with which people and information dispersed across planet. An increasingly large number of the intellectual and academic elite dispense with notions of loyalty (at any cost) to a particularly sovereign. The most they will promise, with formal segregation now a memory, is to observe the law.

As well many of them are conversant and uncompromising on global climate change. It is no exaggeration to say they have made it their life's purpose to save Creation. In practical terms that at the very least begins by exiting an incumbent system that fails badly on the file. These dissidents no longer see sovereign institutions of so-called democratic west as credible authorities in any sense. Most damning is that, even by their own metrics, the left/right division of loyalties systemically has collapsed into a grotesque and barely believable pantomime — an obscene carnival of self‑interest. More to the point, the system grinds badly on the weight of its technical debt:

- **Complexity and compromise:** Policies and decisions are the product of layers of negotiation, legal constraints, risk management, and political oversight. Clear-cut moral decisions are uncommon; ambiguity dominates.
- **Incentives:** Bureaucracies reward process adherence, risk aversion, and incremental progress rather than bold heroism. Standing out for “doing the right thing” can even be risky.
- **Diffuse responsibility:** Large institutions diffuse responsibility so no single person is fully accountable — which often blurs heroism into quiet persistence or compromise.
- **Human variability:** Leaders expressing any dissent or non-conformity to their party's line on a matter will invariably be ostracised or forced to compromise their ideals, courage, creativity

**HERE**

In practical terms 'dying' for the planet means checking out of the incumbent framework for what constitutes prestige and credibility; and instead operating in the parallel post-scarcity, post-consumerist system design for civilization that is being imagined and assembled. As well, others decide to check-out in order to actively contradict what they see as arbitrary norms and standards. Both sets overlap; they are dissenters, and in a myriad number of ways, choose to live on their own terms, whatever the opprobrium. I am not referring here to the legions of protestors or rioters who take to the streets to make some kind of statement periodically, but rather those with the knowledge, experience and skills to actually disrupt the institutions of state (public and private) by simply having the temerity to ghost them; deliberately rejecting them as well as the their standard measures of 'success' (wealth, fame, connection and high office).

Above: Leviathan envisioned as a semper idem of insiders - those 'Inside the House'.







Even the most beautiful, sensitive, rational, poetic, intelligent and sublime ones - simply because we have accepted the generated imagined collectives of 'us' and 'them' of those who claim to lead impossibly large and diverse groups which we are now rallied and called to love as our own and marshalled into the hierarchy as though we were an extension of the war machine operating on *their* social network.

For these 'leaders', 'winners' and 'drivers' - these champions of all that is high and mighty - and their ambition (and that of their children) we have made those other beautiful ones foreign by turning them away for a mere utility - a travel document. A passport and the cash carried with it. As well an unforgivably high standard of permanent disparity. Which is to say any disparity at all.

This is war even when it is conducted by other *mercantilist* means. It is Indiscriminate violence perpetrated by the *very* *strongest* upon the 'other'.  Ask the question: If they place themselves above all others and follow no one then *what* do they follow? What are their values. What price will they sell a thing and how is that price to be denominated? 

This is how the United States dollar lost its legitimacy. It failed because it became too tempting an instrument to be used against *any* adversary in *any* domain through executive action - behaviour which continues unabated even now. It *was* to be a vehicle of persuasion - a legitimate *transparent* instrument of tender for consideration. Instead it became Tolkien's one ring to rule them all Or at least ensure survival and comfort - even if it means that a growth spreads wildly and uncontrollably - sown on the endless fruitless toil of weekend weak-end humanity.



## Without A Follow

In society we rally to our institutions and symbols and seek to preserve them when they and their agents (our servants and delegates to them) express plainly that they are aligned with some greater sense of meaning or purpose than those institutions, their careers or even the sovereign itself. In the twentieth-first century most of us in the west are cosmopolitan in our connections. Their appeals to our loyalty to their persona, party, ideology or even vision of nation-state has little purchase; at least for humanist; those whose preferences don't rely on arbitrary factors such nationality, so-called race, ethnicity, tribal or family ties.

The sovereign and its agents will fail to *arbitrarily* dictate preferences by influencing the lives of people whose rights remain intact; who have met every civic obligation expected of them of law or civic compact. For in all of history we naturally expect our superiors to use their office and place in the hierarchy to guide us to *our* betterment. They are to groom us to so that we may replace them and carry our peace, order and *good government* forward. They are to influence us to behave in ways that are in our own enlightened self-interest and to stand without support, independently and autonomously so that we are prepared to accept a place in their structure as a legitimate innovation designed to evolve our collective. If they are unable to create systems that do this and if instead their systems are built to perpetuate them and theirs in their place as a 'pal in tier' competitive from their privileged angles to preserve their capital at the expense of the those 'beneath' and yet if they style themselves as meritocrats and liberals committed to democracy and the *true* spirit of the west, they lose *all* credibility and legitimacy decisively.

We don't even have to cast a ballot such is our capacity now to live without their onerous burdens. We have the insight to transition to a world of autonomy. These are our circumstances today in a post-scarcity reality: We need very little to afford us the basic needs of life if we make *ourselves* responsible for our mental, spiritual, emotional and physical wellbeing. So little in fact that most governments in the west could comfortably distribute a basic subsidy, perhaps contingent on behaviour which over time reduces their dependency on its provisions for health and security while measuring and improving their quality of life doing something that they would prefer - something or several for which they have an affinity for and which provides some meaningful benefit to the world at large - or at the very least cause it no harm. Anything really to while away our time to either cause no harm to others but in reasonable comfort and with the freedom that risk and opportunities afford. And who knows even the most forsaken might might yet discover a passion or develop some useful skill to redeem themselves, turning truth into something better, incrementally reducing their risk, and perhaps affording society the opportunity to embrace them again instead of incarcerating them at enormous cost to both perpetrator (the Self) and the victim (the Commons), as well to our ecology (Creation) in time, energy and material.



## Without A Mission

There is only one thing greater than our institutions for those that occupy their offices. On this there is overwhelming consensus: they place a premium on their reputations, careers, personal wealth and their friends and families. In whatever order those are placed - they are no different from you and I. What is missing however and what separates a public servant on a mission is that they place the Commons and Creation (or if you prefer the ecology) *ahead* of those other things. Above all, they speak truth to power (which for them are the people). This is a truth that true believers in democracy (anarchists) hold to be no longer self-evident. Instead of admitting a truth and then working to secure increment aesthetic improvement, they have gone backward. What our incumbent leaders have done is adjust a truth they find inconvenient because they cannot secure a consensus of electors to support them otherwise. Over time the accumulation of these *compromises* degrades the beauty of our ecology, our commons and ultimately every individual self who still persists (lives) in them. It is always the *vital* polarities that suffer before our institutions collapse exhausted - the ecology and our identity and sense of self. This time we have data telling us clearly we are heading into Ragnarök and the struggle for the allegiance of innocent souls caught in the crossfire of the pitched battle between Creation and the giants who defy virtue (arete) and the ecology within which it flourishes at *any* cost. One's life is a suicide mission - it ends in death *if* we choose to live first. What separates a giant from a man who 'walks with God' (and is so possessed of virtue) is that the giant places his life before the other regardless of merit and virtue. The man on the hand accepting his fate (God's will) and his station in life, keeps faith with the virtue within him and continues to make his path in life. He may not command much (in fact he deliberately chooses not to). However, he is in *full* command of his faculties and works to acquit and represent himself well.

>These are dangerous days
>To say what you feel is to dig your own grave
>Remember what I told you
>If you were of the world they would love you
>
>~ Sinead O'Connor (Black Boys on Mopeds)

Cash and the institutional esteem of office are the only tools available to the Sovereign and its agents for securing 'the help' when competence (at least with integrity) can no longer be bought; *loyalty* is now the only thing now which can be bought by the impersonal institution and it is bought and sold as a transaction between *individuals* whose claims now to represent an institution of state is compromised because they are now acting as themselves and not the officer in their bid to secure a cadre of cohorts through a process of identifying and recruiting a coalition of the willing (and at least somewhat able). At the very least the line has been blurred as to where self ends and where the Commons start. Pragmatism of the political realist is called for; combined with the idealism of liberalism the anarchist pivots to the ecology as the terrain to serve and protect. Everyone else has been bought - that is the prudent and conservative *assumption.*

That is the paradox and why, ultimately, money has lost its purchase, or footing; it press gangs the least among us who have a modicum of ability and a penchant for the egoic attractions of office. Men with a bare standard of acceptability and aesthetic appeal who have needs, ambitions, secrets (financial pressure, career insecurity, addiction, social isolation) are targeted and groomed; they're offered favours, social inclusion, access to resources or information and a culture of dependence and reciprocity develops lubricating a parallel economy of mutual liability inhibiting the whistleblower. This system attracts the likeminded among a younger cohort who infer acceptability and follow their example. Weak governance, including (the persistence of paper cash), secluded private settings, blackmail or threats enforce compliance. Detection is evaded while opportunities are taken to expand the range of *compromises*.

Meanwhile small transgressions or ethical compromises are normalized, dismissed as nothing important or made to look harmless. There is a constant and frequent demand for privacy in society - that too in the world of a profoundly exploitative social network, which belies a need to identify those with, and crucially without, the integrity to govern well.

A higher bar is expected from those who aspire to lead - they are expected to acknowledge our overriding priority without hedging. Granted this is a traditional way of thinking about leadership more appropriate to monarchy than liberal democracy but it is how I think of leadership. 

Large enterprises are an extension of the state institutions and you see this through the open promotion and support of 'national' champions by elected representatives. Though our global economy is theoretically integrated and firms invest broadly and internationally, senior corporate leaders firms are expected to pledge loyalty and allegiance - first to their tax authority and then to the 'dollar regime'. The concept of firm extends to institutions generally - including universities and hospitals many of whom have quarterly revenue targets; certainly those which are run for profit or are dependent on the munificence of benefactors are susceptible to the whims of those with capital.

The scope of these ever larger firms make them too big to fail. Incumbent office holder at both these firms and in the institutions of state have every incentive to ensure that challenges to the system are parried; keeping the financial markets afloat is essential to maintaining the broad confidence that keeps everyone at their post enjoying their perquisites. 

There is no profound philosophy driving this seemingly systemically collective compulsion. It is a balance sheet whose rules are routinely kluged to give you an acceptable picture. It is one which demands for everyone always that income exceed expenses so that everyone grows as much as possible indefinitely - an impossibility - which for now comes at the cost of our ecology, and if you really examine the situation, the quality and value of our lives themselves.



## A Quest Called Tribe

Democracy is the matter of deciding how we *all* live together. How we choose, after careful thought and deliberation how to co-exist. An anarchist examines the question as a human being not as a member of this, or some other ethnographical category or economic and/or political constituency. It is paradoxically however at once a scaling of tribal behaviour borne of an egalitarianism founded on homogeneity, yet at the same time a modern system whose optimism is founded on the idea that most of us don't actually use law in our everyday lives; it is largely irrelevant. Limits to our haviour may apply in our shared spaces - speed limits and smoking bi-laws and so forth  but it's really common sense which dictates our passage through our day. This is a *Quest called Tribe*; it advocates the idea that we are one human tribe regardless of our habits and appearances. Increasingly we have the technology to enable life without law entirely. One without even jobs (as you currently know them).

Elsewhere I've explained Trinity Bellwoods Park (TBP) as a improvisational process to recognize truth for what it is so that time may be invested so that a return may be realized as an incremental improvement to one's life or *immediate* circumstances. Anarchist don't delegate solutions to the world's problems to corporations or governments but rather choose to take matters into their own hands and expect, in time, to find likeminded people with which to foster *genuine* communities (collectives of people gathered to create value together). TBP rests on the idea that counterproductive behaviour is a difference in degree and not in kind to criminality or mental illness. It is something we all express and changing the world begins with practices that develop our capacity for reason, empathy and self-care before we reach out quietly to probe for likeminded people who have the talent and capacity to build a new virtual machine, a *Machina Virtualis*, in parallel to our tired old mainstream frameworks.



## **Utilitas et Veritas**

The prize is enormous but difficult to secure: an order that is truthful and useful yet almost shorn of law and economy entirely as aggregate frameworks except as fundamental commands. Instead we each administer *ourselves* as we prefer in a reality bounded by what is amenable in a system if it is to remain in equilibrium (sustainable balance); animus is checked and amended in the smallest transactional increment while we actualise liveness (anima) by acknowledging our obligations to respect others and their boundaries.

Yet this pursuit is obstructed by the immense complexity of the body of law—layered over decades with *compromises* meant to simultaneously satisfy disparate constituencies. This is legal *technical debt*: code written under constraint, weighed down by countervailing provisions that “split the material difference.” Like software, law evolves under pressure. With time short and existing architecture rigid, legislators often choose the path of least resistance—adding to complexity rather than resolving it. The result is a rising computational cost: the cost of *interpretation*.

One solution *via negativa* is to pare down legal code to its fundamental intention: protect the person. That means recovering the simplicity of the most basic contract of all—legal tender—and allowing value to be computed in proportion to genuinely *productive* allocation as each individual sees it and without the coercive devices of corporate or sovereign influence.

All contracts ultimately rest on a fundamental law. When we try to make laws serve every possible interest, they grow complex and begin to undermine their own ethical foundation. Law must express foundational ethics, and ethics must remain immutable—valid in every context. We can now do this by observing and responding to bounded behaviour while even assuring each person their privacy.

Sound law begins with a simple foundation: one that enables outcomes credibly ethical, or at least neutral, to all stakeholders. Every contract under law must, at minimum, avoid creating negative externalities—costs borne by the commons. Over the long run, the total cost of legality should approach zero. The “complex” idea is reconciled with a basic one: if we truly know the difference between good and bad, we have no need for law or even perhaps public policy. What remains is simply to *nudge* each of us toward *self-governance* through appropriate incentives using sound and bounded money.

In the modern world, credentialed and competent leadership should advance us toward transparent market mechanisms—those that *choose priorities well*. The central problem of capitalism is true price discovery: determining an *ethical price* that works for all people, in all places, across time. It is a difficult equation, but its objective solution is clear: it must not destroy value.

Subjective value often demands destruction for comfort, but the more arbitrary our comfort becomes, the less it can be shared. Our resources are finite; ethics is the discipline of their fair use. Solving for that requires a rare quality—common sense—and its scaled equivalent: shrewd, transparent judgment. What we need are credibly neutral, secure nodes of trust—both analogue and digital.

The motto of my [alma mater](https://www.uwo.ca/index.html), the University of Western Ontario, is *Veritas et Utilitas*—Truth and Usefulness. Arthur Kroeger, Canada’s great civil servant, spoke at my convocation in 1991. He also served as Chancellor at Carleton while I completed my Master's Degree in International Affairs there. His Mennonite family came to Canada from the Soviet Union seeking freedom from the animus of unbounded competition, and the possibility of dialogue grounded in fairness.

In his quiet way, he embodied a Canadian vision of legitimacy: a politics that balances loyalty to tradition with openness to the new. Canada has deliberately renounced certain forms of military power to exercise influence founded instead on reason and empathy. That, too, is *Utilitas et Veritas*—the usefulness of truth, the truth in what is useful. Wherever you go, there you are: X marks the spot where value maybe generated infinitum for self, the commons and creation.
