**Alchemy of Truth and Beauty: Monetary Monism**

The Bhagavad Gita (The Song Celestial) describes two iconic figures, Krishna and Arjun, standing between two kindred warring factions. Arjun anguishes at the thought of leading his faction against those of his cousin Duryodhana. 

Krishna consoles and encourages him to raise his sword dutifully. The broader epic in which the episode lies is the Mahabharata, the drama of the two factions - one led by a 'band of brothers' - the Pandavas, each with their own idiosyncratic strengths and personalities - they may not agree on all things, we're, but they are nonetheless aligned to a incumbents'  sense of virtue. Keeping each other in check, together they express the noblesse oblige of leaders who live among those they govern - and like the natural leaders of the [Prehistoric Ledger](https://transition-insight.com/f/the-promise-of-blockchain-and-ai-the-prehistoric-ledger), they contemplate deliberately, challenging each other before forming a consensus and committing to serve their people. 

Duryodhana, their adversary, centralizes is self-interested, privileged and mired in the worldly temptation that leads to extravagance and, ultimately, the exploitation that comes naturally to those who are cloistered in their opaque palaces and have lost touch with the people hoards and centralized power and wealth while the Pandavas only ever serve to distribute it. 

The two camps are *kin.* And this key, because regardless of however much we articulate the adversarial of our political economy as a story of factions or interests, blue versus red state, blue collar versus white, east versus west (or suits versus dungarees as Herb Tarlek once explained on the show WKRP in Cincinnati which neatly encapsulates all three given the eastern etymology of 'dungaree'), the struggle is ultimately *within* each of us. The Mahabharata is an allegory of the inner struggle we each face as we seek to negotiate our self-interests with those of the commonwealth. This transaction is increasingly executed online in an opaque system of centralized rent-seeking nodes - they make no bones about this - they are profit-oriented companies. The inner struggle to manage our inner solitudes is cleanly [acknowledged](https://www.wsj.com/video/series/in-depth-features/sam-altmans-openai-dilemma-profit-vs-benefit-of-humanity/90EA5721-9538-4E34-B422-CBADBE5109B5?mod=Searchresults_pos2&page=1) - it’s a difficult balance between profit and ‘market’ (humanity), and they acknowledge their inherent bias.

But this imbalance is systemically entrenched because, of course, capital can and will buy influence and power - this is not inherently evil - it is self-interested action - but in an environment that isn’t credibly neutral over time, the imbalance grows, and inequity develops - the social and economic inequality leads to political incumbency which in turn perpetuates - over time more and more people are marginalized while wealth and power accumulate. This is problematic for productivity because of diminishing returns that accrue to few nodes. Try as they might, the system cannot allocate capital as productively for the ecosystem as a whole as in a transparent and distributive environment; the primary ingredient for productivity is intellectual capital - information that comes in the form of training, education, knowledge - as access to these are in fewer and fewer hands, economic mobility declines and society erupts - a random injustice by the instruments of authority become a catalyst for widespread protest or violence. With few easy options, political and economic incumbents 'policies become incoherent, and opponents have little else to resort to than hurling crude critiques, personal attacks, or even beginning to target each other for technical infractions - the charges against [Donald Trump](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/law/donald-trump-convicted-87a4e465?mod=Searchresults_pos5&page=1) and [Hunter Biden](https://www.wsj.com/us-news/hunter-biden-gun-trial-guilty-4dd4263f?mod=Searchresults_pos1&page=1) are examples of this absurd and pointless counterproductive tit-for-tat. Worse yet, what passes for political discourse is noise on what is really just ‘celebrity' gossip’ - another aspect of that bizarre prevailing epidemic - that has no real meaning or consequence for our lives. 

Those centralized nodes are aware of the distortions they are creating - it troubles them as much as anyone - even as their treasuriesIt'sge. It’s a distortion exacerbated by the lax fiscal and monetary governance of the token they use (periodic bailouts for systemic institutions - corporations and banks - but not for people). Monism is a philosophical (and theological) non-dualist tradition that explores and draws no distinction between the self and the other. A *systemically* monist approach has incentives that seek distributive equilibrium and balance the individual’s self-interests with the system and its other actors. Perhaps the closest political cousin is utilitarianism (or the greatest good for the greatest number). The economic cousin is, of course, unencumbered and transparent free market capitalism (versus the corporatism that prevails today). The tantalizing prospect of incrementally applying a libertarian paternalism through off-chain governance that evolves to the anarchy of on-chain governance via proof-of-stake tokens is perhaps the most exciting prospect a political economist can ever imagine - it promises systemic governance without authority.

**American** **Transcendence: Choosing Manifest Destiny over Density**

There has never been a country as large and diverse whose people have been freer than America. The vociferousness of the debate that rages on its information highways and byways is deafening. American exceptionalism is *real* In the sense that each hegemony has been in its time. However imperfectly and however much technical and social debt may have aggregated into its political economy. No matter the real influence of big money in influencing policy and profit, there is nevertheless discourse - and debate - passionate enough to overturn regularly cars and buildings and the very citadel of its power. That this could or would happen in any other country remotely as large or complex for a century is unimaginable. 

Live Free or Die is a nice idea. Still, it starts with ‘Live,' and that’s is just about all those of us in the West except the very wealthiest can manage because the first order of business is to make it to the next day - it’s as though we live in a prehistoric time with all mod cons - and none of those have seemed to settle our anguish; it’s as though we’re starting at square one - which is why I started the conversation by referencing our distant past - and need a fundamental reboot. We are moving in the direction - not through conspiracy but through a confluence of perverse incentives - towards Duryodhana (Herod or Nero). We know this - we have the data - power, and money is increasingly in fewer hands. It's time to move on (again) from Live and work on ‘Free.’ The idea of ‘Freedom’ is not new - it harks back thousands of years such that even Ronald Reagan can pay homage to that idea echoed through the millennia from an emergent adversary."

"Govern a great nation as you would cook a small fish. Do not overdo it." ~ Lao Tse (via Ronald Reagan)

Freedom fundamentally concerns man’s capacity to actualize a *direct* relationship unimpeded by interlopers with his environment—his universe—and, through that relationship, commune in *alignment* with that universe.

The modern American nation was founded by settlers who sought a direct relationship with their maker but with a linear sense of history, one that even implied a literal coming of the end of times - an idea that the fearful visualize as an apocalyptic cataclysm even though their classical ancestors of east and west saw time as a continual cycle of generational creation and destruction. The Nataraj above and its perpetual cycle of creation and destruction actualized by avatars of Vishnu and Shiva respectively, with Brahma their ever-constant manifestation beating the drum. It may at times of chaos seem a ball of confusion to us but the beat goes on.

They came to a land whose people still lived in close proximity and communion with nature and, for some time, found fellowship. That chemistry of mystical pagan attachment and direct communion of the protestant (who protested receiving doctrine through interpretation by entrenched Brahmins) persists in the modern era. The spirit of a censorship permission-less life is embedded in the American psyche. 

Eastern teachers Jiddu Krishnamurti and Paramahansa Yogananda found a ready audience throughout  America. And why shouldn’t they have?

The image of Siddhartha (rebel and Protestant) above is from a particularly transcendent part of America—Sedona in Arizona. It seems at peace, quietly perched beyond Phoenix's heavy torpor and Scottsdale's quiet, complacent agony.

In modern times, young Americans have never hesitated to protest and old ones never seem to stop criticizing them. Do you remember President Nixon? And the hippies whose doors of perception were opened by acid and who followed the ‘turn on, tune in, drop out’ lead of Timothy Leary and his collaborator Richard Alpert, who went to India and became Ram Dass. They would rather switch than fight. How different are those who occupy administration buildings at the senseless slaughter abroad that appear to have the stop/start sanction of their leaders? Are their leaders to reconcile the world's factions or perpetuate their divisions? What is their vision of the world, the young ask? They have *a stake* - how real is the stake of the gerontocracy - do they see past the arc of their existence - or are their eyes on the polls? The ossification of incumbency is symptomatic of a broader sclerosis.

Data and money must flow without impedance - with transparency on a network that affords privacy and allows for the real need to monitor threats. A system where identity is abstracted and relative trust is objectively measured to determine network access and purview. Wherever we are, increasingly, we are 'me first’ (because we are disenchanted, alienated and still only able to focus on ‘Live’) - an environment that begs for zero trust.

*Public* permissionless, censorship-resistant and transparent blockchains enable and complete an internet to allow this. The idea of a decentralized token that at once is aligned to the commons and sees beyond the horizon of the present (that has a sense of present and future value) and that is radically decentralized) has started already with the adoption of digital peer-to-peer fully collateralized stablecoins in limited use cases. The piecemeal clarity that is finally being brought by regulatory and legislative bodies implies that these technologies have promise - the reticence can only be put down to the very real disruption that it entails to the existing payment networks and their incumbents. Next, we'll explore the consequences of social and technical debt prevalent in the West - particularly at its Anglo-Saxon core.
