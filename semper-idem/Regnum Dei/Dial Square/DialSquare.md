**To Each His Own...**

The image above is *The Dial Square.* It encompasses the elements required for the expression of virtue through the application of conscientious effort - which has merit (virtue) and productive outcome. It is reflective to the contemplative as he is to it and so it improves over time until the contemplatives time on the Earth has ended. The Dial Square will maintain fidelity eternally as long as creation and its elements allow: It is an *idealized sundial* as seen from above and it provides to the seer (perceiver) the time in space all that he needs and could ever want.

It’s important to note that this is a **modeling framework**. As such, we are not concerned with real-world contingencies like cloud cover or whether it is day or night in a given location. Instead, the Sun’s position serves as an abstract yet reliable reference — a universal constant that offers structure without bias and certainly not deliberate misdirection through the withholding of any data deemed relevant or not.

Imagine the qualities of a square which is at the same time also a dial and in perpetual motion and you have *The Dial Square.* Here's a formal definition of a sundial:

A **sundial** is a device that tells the time by using the position of the sun. It usually consists of triangular (i.e. three-sided) blade that casts a shadow onto a dial plate marked with hour lines. As the sun moves across the sky, the shadow shifts, indicating the time of day. Sundials are the oldest known timekeeping instruments, dating back thousands of years.

Now crucially, any sundial placed anywhere on Earth will yield *equivalent* information to all possessing one; a different telling of time (and so not equal in the sense of identical); a sundial reveals *relative time*, a telling of time that's unique to its exact position and angle relative to the sun. Instead of broadcasting a standardized notion like a clock, it offers a localized truth — a reading that shifts subtly even for those just a few steps away. 

In that sense, a sundial isn’t about *sameness*; it’s about *situated coherence*. Each person’s perspective aligns with their position — a kind of temporal parallax. It embodies a form of *truth-in-context*, where time is still meaningful but never absolute. This is the first in a series of essays that explores the Dial Square as a model for how an individual interprets, processes and accumulates information to live in analog society; but as a system design it is fractal and therefore, scaled, it can also represent a digital governance mechanism that points to a single immutable idea of truth but one that dynamically evolves to continuously provide a *truth-in-context*. 

**....All Together Now**

The Sun has long been worshipped as a God and I spoke in another series of [Deus ex Machina](https://transition-insight.com/research-%26-writing/f/who-is-god-universal-intelligence?blogcategory=Sine+Qua+Non+(Intelligence)) as a theatrical device to reconcile outcomes; well Dial Square is precisely that mechanism, as a system design; an immutable truth that dynamically adjusts to our interactional or transactional reality constantly to become God in the machine; a mechanism to provide transactional (i.e. monetary) monism and a foundational for governance. The notion of a foundational mechanism for governance that essentially models creation itself for modern, pluralistic and secular societies is a seriously big deal. It offers the promise of grand reconciliation - in every sense.

**Stillness and Speed**

You've got to fight for what you want,

For all that you believe,

It's right to fight for what we want,

To live the way we please,

As long as we have done our best,

Then no one can do more

And life and love and happiness,

Are well worth fight for,

~ The Flashing Blade (Le Chevalier Tempête),  [Theme Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j7hFUZB41nY)

To delve deeper into the modeling of a system that works for all let's explore models, symbols and return to the windmill as emblematic of ingenuity and entrepreneurial capital invested to harness creation (the wind). Quixote represents an outdated mode of governance hinging on hegemonic privilege rather than on progressive creation - the ingenuity of empathy and reason in the environment.

We’re not here to pick a fight with entrenched sovereign authority — even one that sees new technology as a threat rather than understanding its progressive potential. However, the truth is, this technology will distribute welfare more equitably through productivity and market mechanisms than the feudalism the Don represents.

**Life, love, and happiness are well worth fighting for.** The **milne** is no adversary; he poses no threat, nor does he seek conflict. Rather, like the Don, he claims to be aligned with the welfare of the people and creation, with humanity in its midst creating a marketplace will decide. While monopolistic power weakens as a result, the outcome is fewer lives lost to poverty and deprivation. This is not disruption for its own sake — it reflects progress along a linear path.

The motion of the wind turning the blades can be observed as a neutral, impersonal force — one that follows the conditions of its environment. As these blades turn, they may momentarily resemble a **wheel** or an **incomplete square** — a form that exists only in the instant it is perceived. In this fleeting moment of creation, one might also recognize the **स्वस्तिक (svastika)** — a symbol of balance, motion, and auspicious potential. The swastika is has **rotational symmetry** reflecting the static representation of continuous motion and has has the benefit of being far easier to render than a perfect dial. Its first appearances date back to 3000 BC in the Indus Valley civilization encompasses spaces spanning from modern Afghanistan down through to Gujarat - the home of my forebears for millennia prior to my family's departure a century ago. But the motif can also be found in the archaeological record of classical Europe too - Troy for example. 

At this juncture let's broaden our scope beyond European myth because these ideas of progress and symbolism distilled into culture are universal and recur throughout global culture. The swastika spread eastward. A tourist's map picked up at station in Japan even today, for example, marks out the location of temples with swastika.

Through time in a given space the overlap of the bi-directional sʋɐst̪ɪkɐ creates the symbolism of yield that has the merit of requiring no tangible yoke (yog or योग) upon another man. I drew two seemingly identical sʋɐst̪ɪkɐ (on the left) one facing left (harmony) and the other to the right (strength), then overlapped them: All I had to do is place one on top of the other to create the Japanese character for Rice Field (below) - one of the first any child learns. I 'hand-drew' both sʋɐst̪ɪkɐ heuristically with PowerPoint shapes but without measurement (with only my eyes to assess *fair* congruity) hence the imperfection of the rice-field kanji. (Below are two more svastika (below) from own deep ancestral heritage of Gujarat and the Indus Valley Civilization whose preservation is in the care of the British Museum.

Now these are paddy fields and require a raised rim to hold the water in which the rice grow. Enclosures have a purpose and it is not necessarily to denote property but serve a functional purpose: safety from vermin, predator, errant seed, or perhaps they are simply a hedgerow to provide cover from a neighbour's disorderly space - productivity requires peace of mind after all not a piece of *property -* only earth. Whatever the governance models prevalent in any community, all are yoked to the land through guidance of leadership. The appreciation of the harvest.

Of course  ( ちょっと失礼ですが ) these are drawn without respecting the customary *kanji* stroke order ( 御免なさい ). Being biased towards self-improvement, art and the contemplative practices humanity takes this symbolism and creates a rote stroke order to render it. Thus creating the art of calligraphy. Kanji is beautiful because while there are characters with up to 29 strokes or more the study of the art allows one to precisely render the character in a correct stroke order (even with by the left-hand - and I prefer my left for writing and drawing); it allows the rote and banal to become artistic. The character above has a checkered quality and past - the passage one after the other of each season. It looks a checkerboard floor - ancient with a sense of pure modernity - reminiscent even of Lloyd Wright perhaps. Its structure is wholesome and stable. It now serves a purpose and its imperfections may incrementally be improved upon with precise measurement next time with *kanban* the checkerboard floor is set and may be constantly improved upon. Each daub of black upon white is the beginning of a constellation that reveals itself one star at a time. It's interesting how random information can come together to trigger insights. 

Marshall McLuhan's references to the emergence of a 'Global Village' describe a world in which electronic media compressed and collapsed barriers to communication connecting us across old boundaries accelerating the emergence of a 'commons' understanding of our shared reality. As well 'Artificial' Intelligence helps unlock some of the more esoteric aspects of this shared reality. In this "village," information spreads instantly, creating an environment where events in one part of the world are experienced almost simultaneously by people everywhere. The [six degree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Six_degrees_of_separation) that separated us are now 'four and change'. The emergence of social media has lead to a massive increase in the volume of data being shared, an acceleration of the speed with which it is disseminated and amplification of tone especially as we tend tend to react rather than respond with deliberate thought. All of which increases the potential for a profound drop in signal to noise ratio and the potential for 'danger on the ground' pointing to an urgent need for us to find mechanisms to govern content with credibly neutral, censorship-resistant tools. That said there's also an opportunity too for influencers who can hone messaging and tone to deliver inconvenient truths with deliberate impactful force - something I explore on X with my own posting - applying the prevalent tone of course ('when in Rome' as it were).

In any case, thoughtful leadership is essential to guide us toward a more cohesive and constructive dialogue and we need a strategy for *content* (in both senses of the word). My role is to make transparent how we bridge the gap between the social and applied sciences to explain how consensus protocols govern data (including money). We are running data into a funnel into a fine aperture that cannot adequately process it; and yet that data needs to accumulate quality at the other end. The imaginative will conjure images of roses, hourglasses and pyramids. We'll draw on these models to frame matters coherently.

**Schooled By Randomness**

The danger right now though is that we rush to conclusion about the data perceived especially as it is often dispersed by cadres of factions whose incentives are not always clearly discerned; or they're driven by short-term timeframes (electoral cycles and quarterly revenue cycles); the result is usually an absolute din online that is borders on chaos: Full of noise with very little of that coherent cohesive commons signal required for sum-positive outcomes that meld our various symbols and ideas constructively. 

The introspective however, will develop the ability to parse signal from the sheer volume data and connect the dots to point them to meaningful observations; I believe this is an aspect of an emerging [singularity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technological_singularity); which way we manifest our escape velocity (towards nihilism or rapture is, however the question in front of us as a species - hence the [fork meme](https://imgflip.com/memetemplate/353468132/Fork-in-the-road); 'risk' is just rapid dislocation (change/volatility) that cuts in *either* direction - one has utility and the other disutility. An indulgent example perhaps but this iconic song randomly making numerous references to 'my stuff' (adoptive hometown*, checkerboard floors, the *idea* of keeping order restored, and Aryan heritage) was one catalyst for me (finally) having the information required to articulate my ideas on this site:

That night in Toronto With its checkerboard floors Riding on horseback And keepin' order restored

'til the men, they couldn't hang Stepped to the mic and sang And their voices rang With that *Aryan* twang

The Tragically Hip ([Bobcaygeon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o6QDjDPRF5c))

**Addicted**

Gord Downie, the Hip's lead singer passed away and it's interesting how some people will look at our mourning of his death and who do not understand our culture or our country as cause for mockery online. We will look past the trolls whatever their office; and when it suits our fancy, we'll throw their coarseness back in the wretched faces. Anarchy seeks to understand nihilism and then look beyond the prevailing bombastic but ultimately pretty vacant consensus that's leading us there in order to point the way to something good. And good is plenty.

The alternative is to be taken down into depression by their callous narrowness as so many contemplative creatives are. Complexity troubles us, yet we are inspired by beauty. The most intricate kanji in common use, **鬱** (utsu, melancholy), is a tangled forest of strokes—its very form an oppressive weight. In contrast, the first character of the Japanese word for beauty, **美** (bi), is stark in its simplicity, and profoundly suggestive of what the idea of beauty ask of one; to simply *be*. And yet, both words—melancholy and beauty—share the syllable **うつ (utsu)**, as if beauty is born of sorrow, or at least shaped by it.

But to complete **美しい (utsukushii, beautiful)** in Japanese, one must append a sound that, by coincidence or fate, echoes **कुशी (kushi, joy/bliss in Hindi)** - that sound too is an inflection that implies one is in a state of 'being beautiful' rather than 'is beautiful'. There you have it - a poetic thread linking the two languages to Siddhartha (The Buddha)—beauty is not simply the absence of melancholy, but its transformation through being joyful. What a thing?

To be amongst *The Tragically Hip*—to immerse oneself in restless art and longing—is to add layer upon layer of form and desire, sometimes without first securing the foundations of need. If we're addicted to anything it's 'the Good' and it's the sorrow of apprehending so much bad taste that ails us.

It is no crime nor foolishness to be Tragically Hip, but a heroic quest—to render art on Earth as it is in heaven, to transcend the banal, to end bad taste forever but it is fraught with peril for the one pursuing it with abandon. Such is our state that we add the word *very* (totemo) - as though it were not enough to be simply beautiful we want to be in the state of being (*~shitemasu) very* beautiful:

"Me totemo *utsukushii* desu ne Totemo utsukushii me wa shitemasu"

It's easy to see, it's easy to see To see only white where colour should be It's easy to feel, it's easy to feel But it's not good enough, even though it's real

Oh please stay away And then we can drink some Ocean Spray Oh please stay away And then we can drink some Ocean Spray

It's easy to breathe, it's easy to grieve To breathe only air where life should be It's easy to laugh, it's easy to cry To cry so so hard that it can't be denied

~ Manic Street Preacher ([Ocean Spray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UAjcuSVZMs))

**Go Slow To Go Fast**

I am frequently brought to tears listening to the songs of my generation, for they catalogue our collective trauma. In these moments, I apprehend the terror, tumult, and transition implied in a pivotal turning of the wheel — a profound shift that leads from chaos to tranquility, a singularity. We are the Nomads who carry, like Atlas, the privilege and responsibility of holding, teaching, and inspiring the coming Heroes as they take up the task of rebuilding our institutions.

Many of our creatives reached into that rarefied space where, their needs having been approximately met, they pressed onward without pausing to recover from their exertions. They strained for beauty — that vision of tranquility where want is removed for all. In that relentless pursuit, many succumbed to melancholy. Some fell to the abusive solace of oblivion provided by substances; others perished as accumulated pain manifested in their bodies — as cancer — a rogue growth that consumes its host. Something similar may happen to our greater body politic if we continue to define ourselves by thingness (an unchecked, destructive hoard consumed by materiality) rather than suchness (truth).

Contemplative creatives have come to realize this emptiness of melancholy. Success may outwardly validate their work, yet they still confront the tangled forest of inner discontent. The removal of ourselves from this chaos to recover, reflect, and introspect is never time wasted. It is necessary to preserve both self and the commons.

In contemplation, we recognize that all things are planted in season — as day turns to night and the lunar cycle guides the solar. Whatever mythological model you choose to animate creation, reality is such ( सच्च् - truth). It permits fruitful enterprise and the thanksgiving of harvest in the right measure. The Universal will provide what we need as we evolve. Drawing fine distinctions between wants and desires is best left to the commons — the market — where we must respond with obeisance to its suchness. Truth compels us to accept the world with grace and gratitude for whatever it yields.

Understand this: we plant and harvest something every second. The minimum seasonality is night and day. Liberty requires that we labor in our field — whatever that may be — unshackled from the yoke borne by beasts of burden. You are human and meant to be free, unlike the domesticated creatures that traded work for the comfort (and love) of our husbandry. We yog to the land. All creatures great and small look to us for its care.

**Man In Society**

As the one, so goes the collective. The twentieth century saw the implosion of an imperial scramble and an the attempt to accumulate and hold capital with a beggar thy neighbour mentality that demanded the exacting of tribute where forgiveness in hindsight would have save us much heartache. This is the world Nietzsche prophesized would arrive after we 'killed' God. He prophesized too the arrival of self-sovereignty and the arrival of one self-assured to define for *himself* value that legitimate in Gods name - The Superman; one who would place himself again, *beneath* God alone as the imitation of the Christ. One who, unlike Siddhartha the Buddha-mind *sannyasin* (renunciate) would return to rebuild - for all to find their Call to Adventure and come together.

That refined symbol of the pre-Christian era — the swastika (above) — was inspiring enough to be adopted broadly by those wielding fungible (hard and coercive) power to restore dignity to a humiliated and beset collective - a nation-state. In the final analysis it exacted enormous costs in treasure and blood. The modern expression of the swastika remains intensely traumatic for some. As I framed for myself the events of the twentieth century as a historian and political philosopher they appear to be a set of trades back and forth by the giants who govern aimed at balancing scales between disparate tribes. A balance that continuously see-saws at times exacting dramatically painful upheaval to ordinary people; often entailing profound grief to peoples who are guilting only of protecting themselves, and their kind, and their capital from the greater avarice of mankind through self-actualization as community. For this simple courage of self-sufficiency they were marched to their deaths.

A person's memories are limited — shaped by their own lifetime and the recollections of immediate ancestors. It is difficult for us to look beyond this recency bias, and it takes a close study of the humanities — alongside a personal history of trauma — to reconcile symbols. My own approach is to direct my focus past humanity and look to creation. I no longer affiliate to its various religions, states, sense of nationality but I feel a certain suchness that is made of the spaces in the times that I occupied them and they come out in my writing quite clearly. I feel affiliated to God alone - it sounds trite and absurd but I can't say it anymore honestly than that.

To the extent that I use symbols it is to express models that allow you to honour your collective and yet treat others to the extent they offer transparent assessment of their alignment to you and through you to creation. Creatives are well-enabled to honor ancient symbols quietly and to create new ones that cherish diversity while remaining equitable and inclusive (hence Regnum DEI).

The 'modern' secular independence movement of India (Congress), founded in the early twentieth century, chose a wheel — the charkha — as its symbol. Used for spinning homespun cotton, it represented the self-sufficiency of home-rule (Swadesh) and was placed on their flag. The related term "weal" originates from Old English and means wealth or well-being. Historically, "weal" encompassed both material wealth and collective prosperity. Over time, its meaning shifted to emphasize public good — the "commonweal."

As this secular nation of 'midnight's children' spun toward the chaos of independence, the charkha was replaced with Ashoka's Dharma Chakra— a symbol nodding to the country's elaborate, baroque complexity, perhaps best exemplified by the relentlessly ornate and noisy Jagannath. Nevertheless, the swastika remains where reverence for creation is demanded by those who abide the eternal faith (Sanatan Dharma — known as Hinduism in the West). 

We draw from our experiences to express ourselves in creative productive work and I can scarcely believe the various facts of my life, including my various affiliations, that possess me wit the responsibility of having to do this. As well I seem to possess some capacity for intuitively parsing and assembling the data required for the purpose. I feel a sense of urgency too as what affiliations and affinities I have to the various cultural traditions and communities, even my football club, begin to fade. It's as though they are fading in me as skepticism and even cynicism concerning the role centralized money plays in them and how polluted they have become by crass commercialism and profit motives. Worse perhaps is the response by collectivist impulses to draw conclusions from simplistic social graphing as to who what they 'want' and who gets 'cancelled'. We're using money to trade joy to the attention-challenged - ones who can't see the fraud being perpetrated by our collective Azazel. Everything has become WWF - a money-making charade that loses its brand to a charity which promptly becomes a parody of itself: "Eats, shoots and leaves" it is humanity's predatory dogma of the left and right utterly lacking in self-awareness and humility. A sheer black mirror tragicomedy that must be arrested by us all together.

My anarchism has evolved to the extent that I'm even neutral now towards the persistence of the species never mind democratic liberalism. There's a spreading imbecility, most prevalent in the Anglo-Saxon west, that appears to hamper our ability to apply reason and empathy simultaneously. *That's* the dying light that I'm *smiling* into. It is the thin line between indifferent apathy and dispassionate reasoned engagement that I walk. It may be a lost cause but it's still a 'Train in Vain' worth catching so let's get on board and press on; London's Calling. What I'm asking of you is hard; to stand up to and face realities - inconvenient truths - that are hard to accept. You need to work *through* them.

**The Dial Square**

I've introduced to you above the idea of the weal of wealth symbolized by squares of speed, stillness, creativity and productivity. Now I'm extending these ideas by introducing to you at a high level the components of **The Dial Square** stylized in the image above. I use it to model a framework for a global political economy and its base instruments - secure and private (nation-state sovereign) fiat money using decentralized proof of stake protocols. This is inevitably a path to self-sovereign money - the circumstance wherein *you* are your currency and have as a persona currency amidst the commons to the extent that you shoulder the burden as a mason for Atlas the stewardship of creation. We are of creation, by creation and so must become unequivocally for creation; when we build with it, we must do so with minimum natural product. This will be our new patriotism: The world is your country, to do good is your religion. I can't change my affection for the countries and people I know but the unquestioned affiliations assigned by giants (so-called leaders) will fade as you find affinity with humans who share your values without the interloping bias and preferences of 'betters' or for that matter 'bettors' who arbitrarily tilt reality to their benefit at whim.

**Components of Virtue (and Virtual Machine - Deus in Machina)**

Having broadly introduced the motor—the engine that embodies both stillness and speed—of the Dial Square, we now turn to the qualities that grant it stability and perpetual productivity. These qualities can be understood as three stages of reception:

- **Layer 2 (Square) - Optimism: Defensively Open Receipt** – an open and constructive approach to engagement to the commons assuming a positive stance. Get = Get while Post > Get (where possible) is the default position of the 'competitive' aspect of this context. We are in receipt of the data current (*dhara*).
- **Layer 1 (Dial) - Reckoning: Settlement and Stateful Solidity** – incrementally aggregating and expressing the state of accumulated transactions with finality. Outcomes are dictated at Layer 0 through the triple constraint of scope, time and cost which in turn influence the breadth of the ecosystem and imply architectural trade-offs. We clarify data with objectivity to derive truth (*diya*).
- **Layer 0 (Yoga Element) - Deliverance: Fair Equivalence** – an integration of capabilities that harmonize (i.e., *yoke*) self-interest with that of the commonwealth by qualifying equivalence and posting yield. This principle is represented by the mathematical symbol for equivalence, Lord Shiva’s tripundra—representing the third eye—and the [*vitarka mudra*](https://www.yogapedia.com/definition/6391/vitarka-mudra) (also known as the 'discussion mudra' expressed by the Buddha, Siddhartha below) - 'equivalence makes us whole'. This is about creating heaven on earth and you will also notice that the equivalence symbol represents [heaven](https://www.no2do.com/synopse/en/trigrams/qian-the-heaven)** in Chinese Taoist cosmology. We apply truth (data now clarified with objectivity) to affect change in the commons with vision - pluralistic fairness to drive holistic progression (*drishti*). In the context of actual blockchain protocols, aspects of Layer-0 governance will go on-chain  (move to Layer 1) this amounts to putting 'Deus in Machina'

Transactional information flows back and forth, in and out, much like the inhalation and exhalation of breath. All the while the ecosystem grows with creative productive purpose driven to an end; relative comfort with economy (conservation of energy and matter) and thus time made for meaningful intimacy with our loved ones - the most productive use of time there is. These stages and their aspects do not merely enhance productivity; they do so from a monist, non-dualist perspective—one that seeks coherence and co-existence on the self with the whole without reference to status-oriented competition.

To the extent that it is effortfully engaged in competitive behaviour the Dial Square is finding the balance between needs and wants by the balancing of sufficiency *within* with desire for manifesting change *without*. This perspective weaves a thread from individual agency through collective equilibrium to positive sum for all through transparency, neutrality, objectivity, energy, optionality, and multi-threading (the ability to evolve towards the deft management of complexity - virtue assessed in real-time - aretē - by a virtual machine). All this comes down to creating a system that assesses for equivalence rather thana plain equality, allowing it to present fair outcomes that allow for pluralism and maximal utility for the commons.

Now, I recognize that some of this language leans toward the technical and is challenging if you don't come from a systems design background. However I am deliberately shifting a conversation that until now has leaned on the telling of mythological and lyrical truths and of contemplative practice towards products and processes applicable in governance. I am moving from making a humanist and emotively compassionate case for change to one that presents practical solutions to our most intractable real-world challenges. The full elaboration of the Dial Square offers us life in a digital world with social equity because it enables Turing-completeness - the capacity for the whole to deal with you as necessary to protect, enable and enhance you (whatever your status in terms of relative trust, your field and your station) to find calling to continuously create the humanistic whole. This is profoundly important because it reconciles notions of fairness through a simple notion. Equivalence - equity with plurality.

**A Grave Matter Concerning Gravity**

The forbidden fruit should have been allowed to drop with dispassionate gravity. It was the sole apple that was to be allowed to fall, plant itself and flourish rather consumed in haste. All God asks is that we delight in creation and in one other - and all it would have taken is turn away from the Ouroboros and its temptations leading to trespass and self-consumption. To choose love with dignity, for the self, the other and the whole.

I will contextualize and explain terminology by framing them in broadly accessible terms. For now, simply reflect on them—consider their meaning in ordinary, everyday language, and let them settle.

Part 3 entitled *The Stone Roses* uses the Structure of the Square *on its own*; that's the model of the digital world as it exists today; individuals as they face the reality of the world civilization needs to be curious, resilient and wary while remaining optimistic in order to develop the Dial and the Yoga Element to handle civilization and yet prevail (find calling and contentment). The scaling of the mature individual with virtue (self-sovereignty amounts to enabling internet architecture with a fully elaborated Dial and Yoga Element. The Square amounts vulnerable humanity at birth in circumstances that allow he elaboration of the self-actualized self (the Dial and Yoga Element)*.* 

Part 4 entitled Our Glass: Redcurrant explores the concept of affiliation - there are distinctions in some languages as to whether 'our' includes another but excludes yet others (Gujarati for one). A conundrum for me since primary school (in Enfield but only a 30-minute bus ride to Highbury). 

Part 5 entitled Yoga Element can only subjectively appreciated but will explore how digital-first market incentives may be used to direct one to their Calling (since you're on your devices all day anyway). At this point we get into policy (law and accounting) - which makes sense because this is all about governance.

**The Semi-Charmed Kinda Life**

My sense of urgency comes from a realization of how deeply immature we remain as a species and how much we needs the guard rails (which some have taken to framing as Paternal Libertarianism) that a scaled fully elaborated Square Dial and its [Deus in Machina](https://transition-insight.com/research-%26-writing/f/tldr-e-pluribus-unum?blogcategory=E+Pluribus+Unum+(Capital)) provides. In a piece entitled [The Making of Ashit Milne](https://transition-insight.com/research-%26-writing/f/the-making-of-ashit-milne?blogcategory=Daily+Planet+(Toronto+Star)) I use the 'myth' of the 100-acre wood by A. A. Milne and its personality disordered characters as a metaphor for humanity's separated tribes or various aspects that need to transcend this immaturity and come together. Even these, in whatever form their 'communities' appear - as nation-states or vast corporations - they are increasingly immaturely formed random artifices of atomized citizens, consumers or colleagues who work and live among each other with indifference - it's a 'severed' half-hearted form of collaboration within which we're asked to precision herd-ourselves into synthetic demographic 'blobs'. In attempting to *remove* bias, they affect violence against our sense of self - our sovereign individuality.

My intuitive compassion or empathy is reserved for the marginalized and exploited among us; the rest including the passively indifferent and utterly self-interested can go hang; they are applying a superficial 'greed is good' competitive framework for pablum of banal material benefit that fails to look beyond one's own lifetime. It is an insidiously 'harm less' form of quiet nihilism.  As I've aged, I've come to truly understand noblesse oblige as a counterpoint to so-called 'moderate' impulses of both so-called 'left' and 'right' in the Anglo-Saxon world. I want to temper my disappointment with the acknowledgement that what we have in the west is a good. Like Churchill I feel it's the worst form of governance except for all the rest. I share his reverence for our institutions as well as his Whig progressivism and attempts to reconcile liberalism with collectivist impulses that valued social equity. 

I feel with empathy the frustration of radical protest movements emerging in the aftermath of the great financial crisis (Occupy Wall Street and The Tea Party) and hope to infuse their energy with anarchist reason in providing a compelling framework.
