Recap: I've used Dial Square (a sundial) as a model to represent a structure that receives a signal from creation. The Square is the physical platform the quality of whose construction depends on the assembling of a 'mound'  (tal/tel) of 'practices' or habits (tevs). These establish a 'personal culture' and the basis upon which one's identity may be abstracted and whose legitimacy (relative value) may be defined objectively by the network (the Commons) within which the mound transacts (participates in the mudra of discussion*. which may also be thought of as nodes of relative 'interest' yielding satisfaction when attention is focused on them.*

Naturally as are the practices so too (generally) is the physical embodiment expressed in a material and energetic sense such that one sees oneself as merely *being* rather than as superior or inferior, less or more, better or worse.

determines how well the dial atop may be set. The signal is of little practical use unless it is interpreted. The Dial Square is a model of an identity wherein the signal received is evaluated. 

At first ones interpretation of reality is rudimentary and basic - a child shown animated shapes reacting with one another for example may imbue personalities ('Triangle' is being bullied by Square but fortunately 'Circle' is there - Square charges but bounces off it. The child may grow indignant at the blatant injustice of the circumstances faced by Triangle and Circle and may discern that the two are feeling fatigued and will ultimately succumb to Square - resistance is futile. The child smashes his iPad so that he doesn't have to watch it. By the way, I'm loathe to say it but the choice of the roles played by the various shapes was random (feel free to mix and match based on your own preferences for hero and villain shapes).

The Stone Rose 'square' represents physical embodiment while the dial represents a perceived signal of what reality amounts to. The strongest ones are proximate and amount to the *qualities* imbued by our family and community and

of materiality by the self and to create value (comfort to create space and time where it is finite) while the Dial is the serviceable self (able to discern relative value of self versus consensus values). Lingam (is language - modeling reality and being (am) in stillness without voice through deep introversion. To know oneself is not possible for there is infinite depth and even this effortful practice in relative term gives you relative depth versus the shallow superficial modeling (simulation) of humanity. Such is practice (transmutation from which creativity/fertility is derived. Legitimate sovereign calls creativity *productivity (growth is too literal and infantile an interpretation - literally applies to infants and cannot be discerned in the fully developed self).*

**Reconciliation**

Reconciliation of oneself to Creation may be modeled as a matter of equivalence. We are clearly not equal to Creation not even in the aggregate, as a species. No matter how “global” our collective self, we cannot imagine our kind (humankind) holds a priori privilege over the planet and the Universe. Such presumption would be the epitome hubris that precedes nihilism.. 

Whatever you may have done in your life to this point, once you understand this, your aim is to be small — but writ large. Like the ant: a symbol of strength in humility, collective purpose, and outsized capacity — capable of carrying and projecting things whose weight is gravitas in quality itself rather than a relative measure of it in quantity (say in grams or ounces). As a milestone in my own time I marked out my 55th birthday when I visited the site where the book of humanity's impact on planet (as the Anthropocene) is being written in slow motion within a grail filled to the brim, Crawford Lake near in Milton Ontario, the site of an ancient settlement it is paradise. Not much is required to for things to grow there. Cedars sprout from stone.

And yet — it may be said, in a moment of insight that borders on hubris — that we approach self-similarity as an imperfect fractal representation of God’s mind. A scale-equivalent to the energetic mind, given our unique capacity as humans to *imagine*. (“How noble in reason, in apprehension how like a god,” wrote the Bard).

Even as we wax lyrical and poetic, for one aspect of reconciliation deals with dovetailing reason (rationality) and romance (empathy). It cannot be otherwise than the best of us are moved to tears by truth expressed as the inexplicably beautiful truth. Yet the mainstay of this work remains the serious business of defining a system design as a myth model for how we transact with one another in the world. Whether we transact specie — coin or the equivalent digital expression of it— the data flows through a join (or node). A Corinth, if you will: a junction through which the transaction is mediated and the self is reconciled to the whole. God willing it is as secure and transparently credible a node as possible.

It may be said that there are three natures of the Universal as man perceives it: the self, the mediated and Creation.

The Yoga Element is the energetic principle that directs the material elements — the chemicals between us — and unifies all things through mediation, so that we may one day make, with our hours, a better bed to lie on. One that is transparently legitimate — or at least a honest telling both in materiality and as an abstraction in both one and in totality. Until then one makes his bed to one day lie upon it and be carried into the mists of time and space having done as little harm as possible to all creatures great and small on their planet abode.

 **一つの二つ** 

You drift through the years And life seems tame 'Til one dream appears And Love is its name

And love is a stranger Who'll beckon you on Don't think of the danger Or the stranger is gone

This dream is for you So pay the price Make one dream come true You only live twice  

~ Coldplay (You Only Live Twice) 

This amounts to a summary of the non-dualist aspect (not perspective) that aligns conscious aspect to the Universal 

Introduction

Recap: The Stone Rose 'square' represents construction of materiality by the self and to create value (comfort to create space and time where it is finite) while the Dial is the serviceable self (able to discern relative value of self versus consensus values). Lingam (is language - modeling reality and being (am) in stillness without voice through deep introversion. To know oneself is not possible for there is infinite depth and even this effortful practice in relative term gives you relative depth versus the shallow superficial modeling (simulation) of humanity. Such is practice (transmutation from which creativity/fertility is derived. Legitimate sovereign calls creativity *productivity (growth is too literal and infantile an interpretation - literally applies to infants and cannot be discerned in the fully developed self).*

Our perception of time is to see water always as a river - in constant flow. It is gravity which makes it a river - otherwise it sits still as a pond or lake (and it doesn't have to be Walden in Concord nor Crawford in Milton for us to agree on this). Being brings with it the perception with consciousness of *change* and it's the motion of our planet around the Sun which brings seasonality to a person at a particular time and place and therefore assigns value to being. Which makes time perfect as the base expression of value (because only the alive - those with perception framed as consciousness) assess and assign value to things.*

Anyone who understand information technology can imagine a world without humans in which bitcoin is being mined and is accumulating in a wallet. It has legitimacy in *relative terms to our existing forms of money* because it at least expressed the idea that 'work' is required to derive notions of value that are universally credible (i.e. truly objective). But clearly a money that is being created without humans is redundant.

How that money is used is down to the *individual* in possession of it. What allows us to install a subjective interpretation of that use is discussion (vitark); this amounts to a real world (human) consensus-oriented evaluation of how energy is expended over time and then used.

*This is why the Tao DChing is so important to Anarchy - it is our first documented expression of an idea (a apprehended with those with drist) that 'order' beyond most people's normal day-to-day evaluation of their lives exists and that is why we have currency as an idea in value and the flow of water (or for that matter of course particle).

 If you were a God, you'd say we are still and turning *in situ* as we have for the last 4 billion years.

We'll talk about productive because it is the key really to assess equivalence (that space between being bab(Talladega Heights) innocence and proper puckka immitation of christ (productive and creative and self-sovereign to the point of renouncning existing sovereigns and their bollocks agents - maintain - fix when not fucking jesus jonesing.

Depends on alignment and community and stakedness (not viable beyond two pizzas or? max? 120ish).

Big needs bounded reality for assessing value (currency) to determine yield. What is yield? How much money do you really need? Yield is where you can live risk-free. (eth for commons).

Stay the  fuck out of the society of worldwide interfund transfers (need stables asap) - too much bullshit correlation and the money swapping hands for the bombs in Gaza unjustifiable.

 

### **1. Assembly/Platform (Formative Phase)**

**Data**: Initially, data exists in an open and flexible state, malleable and responsive to input. On the EVM, this corresponds to transaction data, code in assembly, or contract states before they're processed and committed to the chain. **Personhood Parallel**: This is the early life stage — the individual is open to influence, experience, and external information. At this point, we are in a formative phase where ideas, experiences, and values are not yet set but are shaping the potential for identity.**Key Dynamics**:

- **Exploration**: Just as the EVM's data undergoes computation and assembly, the individual processes external stimuli. This is a phase of *potential* — the person absorbs a range of experiences without a rigid structure.  
- **Flexibility**: L2 networks (like Arbitrum, Polygon) adjust to the platform to streamline data. Similarly, a person, in their early stage, adapts to their environment — forming connections, learning skills, and building perceptions without being bound to a singular path.  

### **2. Processing/Transaction (Validation Phase)**

**Data**: At this stage, the data is moving through the logic of validation — whether that be fraud-proof verification in Optimism, or the commitment of transactions in Arbitrum. The data has been through some layers of logic, but it hasn’t yet been finalized as immutable.**Personhood Parallel**: The individual moves into the validation phase as they grow older, refining their beliefs, ideologies, and values. Experiences undergo filtering and validation — what they internalize as truth versus what they discard as falsehood.**Key Dynamics**:

- **Filtering**: Just as validators confirm that transactions meet criteria, individuals start distinguishing between what is truly valuable to them and what doesn’t align with their core beliefs. This is where the self begins to solidify its preferences and identity.  
- **Heuristic Processing**: The filtering process in L2 networks is driven by heuristics — balancing cost and value. Similarly, individuals filter experiences, choosing what best suits their developing worldview or personal goals.  

### **3. Commitment/Immutability (Consolidation Phase)**

**Data**: The transaction is finalized, committed to the Ethereum mainnet, and becomes part of the immutable blockchain. This is when data shifts from transient or mutable to permanent and unchangeable. It now forms the shared truth of the system.**Personhood Parallel**: The person now has a coherent sense of identity — a self that has been molded and refined through experiences and choices. The beliefs, actions, and values are now embedded in the person’s "immutable" truth. This reflects a mature self that has undergone self-reflection, growth, and adaptation, yet is grounded in core principles or truths.**Key Dynamics**:

- **Immutability**: Once data is committed, it becomes part of the blockchain’s immutable truth — something that cannot be undone or altered. Similarly, as the person matures, their core beliefs become more solidified, their identity more stable. These are principles that guide action and perception of the world — hard-won truths that have survived trials and adaptation.  
- **Reflective Truth**: This is a moment of clarity where the self recognizes and internalizes the results of past actions and experiences. Much like finalizing a transaction, the person now sees the 'truth' of their decisions, which has shaped their sense of self.  

### **Key Forces Shaping the Transition:**

#### **1. Resistance**

- **In Data**: As the data moves through each stage, it may encounter resistance — whether through rejection of invalid transactions or competing priorities in L2 validation. Not all data is accepted into the final layer.  
- **In the Person**: The individual, too, faces resistance from external influences (society, norms, relationships) and internal conflicts (doubt, indecision). This resistance forces refinement and clarification of one’s identity, testing and proving the resilience of the self.   

#### **2. Filtering**

- **In Data**: L2 networks (Arbitrum, Optimism) use filtering techniques to ensure only valid transactions make it through. Non-compliant or unnecessary data is discarded.  
- **In the Person**: The individual continuously filters their experiences, values, and perceptions. What resonates or contributes to their worldview is retained, while distractions or falsehoods are rejected. This process is part of the growth of self-awareness and the consolidation of identity.  

#### **3. Validation**

- **In Data**: Validation happens through consensus mechanisms — validators check that the transaction follows the rules. Any dispute or fraud attempt will be rejected by the network.  
- **In the Person**: Similarly, individuals validate their beliefs and choices through reflection, interaction, and lived experience. When a person faces challenges, their core values are tested, and only those that align with their authentic self remain validated over time.  

#### **4. Emergence**

- **In Data**: Once data is finalized and part of the blockchain, it becomes a permanent record of the network’s truth. It can’t be altered, only built upon.  
- **In the Person**: The transition to maturity results in a stable, cohesive identity that becomes the foundation for future actions. Like blockchain data, this identity is immutable once set but can be reflected upon and built upon in new directions. The person’s identity becomes part of the “immutable truth” that defines their personal narrative.  

### **Narrative of Modeling Humanity — The Person**

Joseph Campbell exhorts us to identify with the light within and not the bulb. With introspection and age we discover this as we face the need to let go of materiality. The very notion of scarcity becomes untenable as we realize that nothing ever truly was ours - not even our bodies. The need to identify with consciousness is apart from anything else necessary to transcend an existential crisis that is bound to happen when we're too tied up with our physicality - our bodies. Care as we will for them, they are machinery with a well-defined end-of-life and or best by date - and this is ok.

The journey from assembly to immutable truth mirrors the human process of self-discovery, growth, and maturation. Data, in its raw form, can be likened to a child or an individual before their core beliefs are solidified — open, flexible, exploratory. As they engage with the world, the data (like the person) undergoes validation, refining what is useful and valuable. Eventually, both the data and the person reach a point where their fundamental truths are set, becoming an unalterable part of their respective systems. But just as blockchain data can continue to accumulate upon the foundation of immutability, the person, too, continues to grow, adding layers of wisdom, experience, and evolution — rooted in the solidified core but ever expanding. 

 **No Alarms And No Surprises** A heart that's full up like a landfill A job that slowly kills you Bruises that won't heal You look so tired, unhappy Bring down the government They don't, they don't speak for us I'll take a quiet life~ Radiohead (No Surprises) How do we cultivate a kinder gentler stronger humanity with Übermensch as a template? One more resilient to the vagaries of our collective indifference and carelessness? He'd know better than I. How do we One that truly echoes Rome's republican resilient virtue at the full-stretch Londinium glory (you visit Bath to get a sense of how their governors once retired to the provincial towns of England) but with all the tools that *our* modernity offers to restore and transcend its relative equity?How do we create a safer collective that holds contentment more often? I'll keep modeling with allegory, myth and model for a while but the answer lies ultimately with the transparent and precise calibration and expression of price and value in the market which then allows for managing risk to ourselves and the heritage bequeathed to us by our forebears (intellectual, notional and material). This is a profoundly important matter and one that for me developed a sense of severe urgency in the wake of the Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and Hurricane Katrina. Environmental cataclysm may always claim life but that our way of living should exacerbate these risks rather than mitigate them is profoundly disturbing. The loss of life is tragic and so too, if you will forgive me the application of reason in this instance as well as empathy, the destruction of enormous capital that our forebears expended time and energy to accumulate and bequeath to us and that we allocated so poorly. If you want to understand the volatility and escalation of climate risk you don't have to examine global aggregate temperatures; we present enough existential risk to ourselves in the face of creation through our ineptitude in managing capital for development that has credible universally desired outcomes regardless of the weather never mind longer term climate trend.But we are introducing human-centric architecture and governance in a measured fashion so let's return to the allegory and metaphor encoded in the Dial Square and in particular the pillar of a flourishing rose made of stone upon which it is fronted.

**Fitter, Happier**

Fitter Happier More productive Comfortable Not drinking too much Regular exercise at the gym (3 days a week) Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries At ease~ Radiohead (Fitter, Happier)

Think of the Dial Square as representing a new-born human being. Then *kinder* - the German word for child hints an obligation and responsibility. At birth the child has transitioned from its united state of "no such thingness" (bonded to mother) to "suchness" and "thingness" (a separate independent personality) as part of the whole. It has the ability to gauge and assess or at least model truths about things seen and unseen in the world and to act with some agency. In having come out into the cold light of day from the safety of the womb, once the trauma of separation from deep comfort of the leaving the womb has passed, it finds itself (one hopes) in the hands of those who will care and nurture it during the exceptionally long time (relative to other creatures) it remains vulnerable; among its first decisions is the delegation of its security - the management of its security through the provision of labour and capital - the energy and matter to secure for it what ultimately matters most - its being.It begins life with the anguished cry of 'zero trust' as it emerges into the world and then modulates this from a terrifying starting point as it draws distinctions in its frame of reference. It begins to assess other entities to which it then assigns relative access to its person; this is analog (material) privileged identity access management (PIAM). It's the joyful smile of recognition in beholding a caregiver; the questioning curious turning of an engaging head in a new environment as it registers its surroundings; and the gift of fear when perceiving the dissonant sounds and movements of anger or violence where none is expected. The growing child begins to develop perspective through a sense of curiosity and wonderment. Over time as information accumulates a record (ledger) of the entity's transactional history with others forms. This provides the person as it matures with an ability to assess and trust and assign responsibility for the delegated responsibility of its care which includes an interest in intimacy; not just parents, but potential mates (partners in life and business platonic or sexual), colleagues, mentors, 'superiors' at its place of work etc. An analog (i.e. heuristic) form of social credit rating is developing. Attraction and repulsion to the other serves to model reality in the social nexus.Volatility may then be expressed as emotional suffering (not to be confused with the blush of discovery - of 'being seen' -) for example. You may think of this as a chain of events (transactions) that are immutably embedded in memory and brought to bear when required when there is a meeting - 'a coming together' for transactional behaviour. Ideally there are no alarms and no surprises as it transacts with its family and community, and beyond it, the sovereign (a public guardian and trustee of last resort), or the corporations to which it has deferred the care of the citizens it employs.  A heart that's full up like a landfill A job that slowly kills you Bruises that won't heal You look so tired, unhappy Bring down the government They don't, they don't speak for us I'll take a quiet life A handshake of carbon monoxide

And no alarms and no surprises No alarms and no surprises No alarms and no surprises Silent, silent

Yet the variances in outcomes for the newborn is dramatic in our modern world - and I'm not alone in feeling and expressing a degree of anger, frustration and deep sorrow - even guilt and complicity about this. That only takes you so far however and so we pick ourselves up in an effort to use our calling to the betterment of the whole tribe.

**The Best Thing**

I could be discontent and chase the rainbows end I might win much more but lose all that is mine I could be a lot but I know I'm not I'm content just with the riches that you bring I might shoot to win and commit the sin Of wanting more than I've already got I could runaway but I'd rather stay In the warmth of your smile lighting up my day, the one that makes me say 'Cause you're the best thing that ever happened to me or my world You're the best thing that ever happened, so don't go away I might be a king and steal my people's things But I don't go for that power crazy way All that I could rule I don't check for fools All that I need is to be left to live my way, listen what I say ~ The Style Council ([You're The Best Thing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0HMAVU1k7kg)) Paul Weller sings to the *divine* within here. This is a song sung by one who has worked through *the roiling stone* severed personality disorder foisted upon him by society to find himself in creation and has become self-sufficient - content within himself - to claim the return on his investment in self and become *Roi* (king within); that is my own reading of the song. Empathy is a hard thing to carry in a modern complex world with such seemingly arbitrary variances in outcomes because it brings a degree of sadness as you look out at humanity, even as you apprehend the beauty of creation beyond it. Philosophically I choose to look straight past man - we are strangers when we meet - and keep my eye focused on the anarchic beauty of the natural world and draw from it models of synergy, symbiosis and an overarching sense of unified *anima*; this apprehension brought notions of wholeness into my own discipline - the philosophy and practice of governing enterprise software delivery. I invoke Henry David Thoreau:*"We are sojourners in this world, as all men are, who are born of it. The greater part of the universe is not visible to us. The whole world is a canvas to our imagination. The stars in the sky, the earth beneath, and the sky above, form an eternal picture in which we are but a passing shadow. Nature, in its simplicity, invites us to admire and reflect, while we are but brief passengers on this stage, passing through it for a short time."*He asks us to reflect and draw another breath of contemplation with a view to do something in our calling. I look with optimism at the various clubs (communities) in this space who are focused on developing incremental improvements to the way we manage our affairs to resolve what we call the problems of civil society and be a part of something larger than myself. I endeavour to make whatever contribution I can. Fast forward in your experiences through adulthood and into that complex modernity. in which we function as an individuals fronting ourselves to the outside world in our transactional experiences. We develop a complex network of relationships with each other. ------------------------------------------------------------- 

**You Only Live Twice:**

*****  I use Dial Square as a myth model deliberately, as it represents the most broadly distributed aspect of my persona — something shared with others, yet not mine 'contractually' — that I self-selected as a child (unlike the cultural or systemic elements I inherited and have no choice but to carry: Englishness, Gujarati-ness, East-Africa-Walla, Canadian, and British citizen). It’s the original name of my football club, Arsenal FC - the one I support with coin and attention. English clubs are older than most nation-states - so it can border on the tribal and in some sense may even be seen as a proto-[Network State](https://thenetworkstate.com/). The lack of a contract means it can only be inferred or abstracted as a part of my identity from my behaviour - a personal history of where I've been and what I've done that involves the Club - including, not least of all, the creation of this literature.

** The Vitarka Mudra, also known as the "mudra of discussion" or "gesture of debate," is a hand gesture used in Buddhism to symbolize the transmission of teachings and intellectual discourse. It is typically formed by touching the tips of the thumb and index finger together to create a circle, while the other fingers are extended upward, often with the palm facing outward. This gesture represents the search for understanding through debate and discussion — a movement toward equivalence (signified by the three extended fingers) between the self and the commons, and from there, toward Creation as a unified whole (signified by the the circle).
