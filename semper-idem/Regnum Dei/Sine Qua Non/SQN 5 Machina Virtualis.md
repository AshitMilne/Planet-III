## Introduction
If Anima is the innately rational yet connected aspect of intelligence, regardless of linguistic convention—the anarchic intelligence that emanates in Creation (the ecology)—then we approach the "other" as a uniquely embodied identity, in plain language, a person (not a role, responsibility, or title). Previously, we noted that Creation expresses masculine and feminine aspects in all life, distinct from notions of gender or sex. As humans, we compete, explore, and press into adventures. However, we also nurture, hold, mentor, encourage, and long to be at home. These are not mutually exclusive traits, nor are they paradoxes. We hold these seemingly contradictory aspects just as we, in turn, exhale and inhale to seek balance. We each have bespoke ratios of these traits, and we imagine that we may guide each other to express our two aspects in perfect balance as a species, as a whole.

This piece aims to reconcile notions of competition with anima that exclude animus—hostility and defensiveness (i.e., envy or vindictiveness). In our pastimes and games, we set forth rules and boundaries that define the parameters for legitimate behavior (truth). Invariably, when we emphasize the end result, beauty is removed from the spectacle.

Any exploration of prehistoric reality is conjecture, but remaining unchanged in a foundational sense for 50,000 to 100,000 years, we may postulate with common sense as a foundation. The close-knit communities of our distant past were naturally inclined to expressing anima both at home, by the hearth, as well as away in the wilderness—collaborating to scale their tribe.

Animus was the impulse of the challenge—a madness with method, perhaps best exemplified by the Kiwi Haka, wherein the 'All Blacks' tell their opponents in no uncertain terms, drawing a line in orthodox black boy fashion that they will not partner with them today. They have an obligation to those they represent and to Creation itself to decimate them in the ritual of good sport. Brazil's Capoeira reflects a similar idea—but very differently; through dance. Similarly lines may be drawn with other forms of  artistic expression and most certainly rhetoric—*if* it is consistent with what one sees in reality from the creator.

Pervasive through nature is the idea that conservation of energy (capital) is paramount, especially in times of real scarcity. It demands that peace and the search for equivalence be the default behavior.

In the 'real world,' however, when surviving at any cost became an imperative, a tribe's introspection through internal dialogue concludes that its persistence requires the decimation of the others. In a sense, a tribe's store of capital had been depleted; its balance (or equilibrium) hacked. It now needs to be restored at the another's expense while preserving what remains of its own (at this point, life and the bloodline).

This final segment of Sine Qua Non articulates a modern alternative for projecting apex authority: the power that comes from a self-sovereign narrative; an internal vision 'bored' into one's psyche so completely that one makes it real in the world. One takes maximal custody of the world and then, through it, husbands creation and the commons because the Sovereign, having lost legitimacy, cannot maintain a persistent quorum among the people or even decorum. Its behavior is inchoate and incoherent, so we are transitioning to swaraj, or the self-sovereignty of practical and pragmatic life—anarchy.

In 1896, Vilfredo Pareto heuristically observed that eighty percent of peas came from about twenty percent of his plants. However, we don't just eat peas: a complex modern political economy requires a profoundly diverse set of personalities to meet our equally complex set of needs and wants. In any case, contentment doesn't just come down to abundance (which, as choice proliferates, can have the opposite impact).

Each of us has a unique set of attributes which lock or bind together to amount to something called an **identity** that expresses a **personality**. The personality has a telling impact upon the collective meaning; it imparts an aura such that even an observant guest or visitor will discern the nature or quality of the nexus of ties that bind us in a group. For the canny reader of people, we practically wear the sum of who we are on our person: our face, our gait, what we do with our hands, the way we wear our garments; whether we choose to speak or listen, and with whom. As well, the words we use (if we think it worthwhile to have a conversation). This nexus of ties amounts to an **augmented reality** or **meta-narrative**: something that virtually exists, is readily perceived by a keenly attentive interloper, and can even be 'graphed' on another dimension or plane of perception.

In civil society, as it functions for most people, those ties are dictated by the power and influence an individual wields over others. This has, until recently, come down to how much money they command personally or through their positions of authority. As well, **charisma**, or the ability to appeal to emotion and established bonds of love, is a factor.

In the last century, technology enabled the sudden exponential spread of ideas, information, and conversation. A quarter of the way through this century, that conversation broke down. For me personally, four events stand out:

1. **The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan beginning in 2001:** Neither fundamentally solved problems but rather exacerbated them. The justification for the conflict in Iraq was a particularly galling fraud.
2. **The 2008 Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP):** Their extraordinary bailout of incumbent financial institutions and other corporations ultimately served no purpose in solving the underlying systemic inequity, particularly in the wake of the expenditure of public funds on conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.
3. **The 2013 persecution and exile of Ed Snowden:** He exercised his First Amendment right to raise the United States' government's massive (illegal) surveillance of ordinary, innocent Americans.
4. **The 2020 acquisition of corporate bonds by the Federal Reserve:** This was done through 'Special Purpose Vehicles'. The justification, a flu virus, was deemed "unusual and exigent." In my view, these went at least against the spirit, if not the letter, of the law dictating the regulation of these debt instruments. At any rate, it revealed just how fragile this system is.

All of these attempts to perpetuate the power of incumbent institutions and their officers' privileges served only to discredit them in absolute terms. For me, the loss of their legitimacy was complete and final—ending a journey that began shortly after I was born with what was then the 'temporary' suspension of the Gold Standard. I no longer recognize the authority of the United States government nor that of its agents (including corporations operating within its frameworks). In short, they are aggressive expressions of panic and hysteria: animus directed by a leadership as much towards stakeholders as to outsiders. It is deeply offensive to a wide swathe of the engaged public and incurred deep hostility from both the left (Occupy) and the right (Tea Party).

As well, I no longer assume that the guarantees and courtesies afforded me by my own 'countries' (Canada and the United Kingdom) are available, beholden as they are to their Hegemon. For the most part, and as it relates to our day-to-day lives, our laws are sensible, and of course, I obey them. But as for those statutes governing economic contracts? They are for me, including that foundational contract called the United States dollar, null and void. I limit my use of them to the degree possible. In a very real sense, I operate as though I'm an independent country—running an austerity program for as long as it takes to enable total swaraj—self-determination and self-reliance. I am no longer just a philosophical anarchist but increasingly a practicing one.

This is a conversation about intelligence, and as with the individual, so with the sovereign: how you define (value) and use (price) money speaks volumes. In the case of the United States Government, it is "a tale told by an idiot, full of sound and fury, signifying nothing." What I know today with certainty is that the country and the regime it governs are bankrupt and have been my entire life.

From a systems perspective, the structure represents an unstable server; its equipment is a loss leader for the poorly written code that runs it. It generates too much noise and heat at an exorbitant and increasingly untenable cost to those it was meant to serve. Many of us, realizing that the machine increasingly seems to serve its own interests rather than those it was installed for, have decamped to set up a parallel Advanced RISC* Machine (ARM). To understand this new model 'ARMy' system design, you have to go back in time to understand how people conceived of, created, and critically, distributed value when the sum of the parts were designed to fit together rather than cobbled together from a set of random surplus bits; and crucially, before money (of any kind) existed. The maintenance of a level or equilibrium of welfare was of paramount importance regardless of who generated the 'productivity.'

Since all contracts are compromised or at least suboptimal, let's take money out of the equation to imagine an alternative system: one without pyramid scheme hierarchies of practical strangers commanded by the self-styled giants among us. As well, let's pivot from intelligence, which we might agree is equivalently, if not equally, endowed in that we all have a gift or a **Calling**, to talk about leadership in an anarchist context.

If we have gifts or a Calling, then they are useful insofar as they make our living possible, interesting (in a good way), and fun—in that order. You might not enjoy the prospect of changing a flat on a dark November morning in the middle of nowhere, but doing it safely will allow you to persist. It will be interesting the first time and result in some growth—a new skill and a light dopamine hit from having solved a problem without help. Alternatively, you could take the **Path of Least (POL) Resistance** and call a tow truck—spending money (after taxes), learning nothing, and becoming boring, ordinary, and unattractive. It's the slippery slope to becoming the inspiration for a new vision for mediocrity as a slow-cooked form of postmodern ambition; something whose development may be savored over the long span of a deteriorating circumstance you call **quantity of life**. There's a quiet epidemic wherein people put as little effort as possible to get as much out of the 'system.' It bleeds a system that doesn't itself actually create value anymore while removing from you the capacity to generate it for yourself.

This is what life lived on devices is doing to us: It's giving us one easy fix after another, incrementally removing our capacity for thought and action and, incidentally, thinning both the ranks and the pipeline for leadership—people willing to make important but difficult decisions to make investments that pay off over time (the only true form of passive capital there is): the **Path of Most (POM) Resistance**—the one that yields long-term benefits over an infinite time horizon.

So this, then, is how we take money out of the equation, or rather, reconstitute it as an opportunistic perspective that demands concrete real-world solutions to a current dilemma in small ways that builds attitudinally the momentum and platform for continuous yield. This is an **attitude** that seeks personal gain in real terms while reducing transactional 'noise' in the Commons. This is an attitude that frames wealth in terms of intelligence created through knowledge—in a term—**intellectual (personal) property**. As a starting point, it says to the world, 'You've got enough to deal with; let me see what I can do to solve my own problems.' It builds self-esteem and rapidly develops into a capability for solving other people's problems without costing them anything.

This is **virtual money**, and it's what made prehistoric communities work, or even the indigenous ones that came before us here in Ontario, where I live, such as the Wendat and Haudenosaunee. In a very real sense, they made anarchy work for centuries by harnessing that feminine aspect of the masculine, **anima**, which seeks to nurture, build, and create oneself and then project **soft power** or capability rather than exploit or extract with fungible coercive force. The example above is a classic one—no guy would want to be caught 'up all ends' in the predicament above if he were out on a date. He'd sooner impress with a slick show of competence. It's an opportunity to impress and close the deal—not a problem. It's serendipity. Even if you don't know what you're doing, being able to take command of a situation like that calmly is a cultivated quality borne of repeated POM experience.

What made them different was the power of 'free stuff.' Our first nations were 'open source' in the real world. They were Apache before it was software.

In *Debt: The First 5,000 Years*, David Graeber, the late anarchist anthropologist, imagined our prehistoric ancestors wandering in small groups—well under the 150-odd with whom we can maintain a meaningful relationship. In these small, closely-knit communities, we kept an approximate mental tally of who did what, mostly to assure that nobody got left behind in terms of having what they needed to be a meaningful part of the community. Their idea of value is that it should be **distributive** and that it has no price (because it is priceless). To discover something that serves to preserve us—a method for making fire or preserving meat or fish—and to not share it freely with people who present no sign of threat (copyright or patent) is a modern invention, and it is deliberately aggrandizing and non-distributive. Writ large, they create the animus-driven political economy we have currently that continues to concentrate capital such that 1% of the world's population now holds over 50% of its notional capital (money).

Now, we have notional money because, unlike the Wendat or Haudenosaunee, we have created a complex civilization that divides labor because many hands make light work (theoretically, anyway). That division, in one sense, ties us closely together and binds us as one whole thing so that we may not easily separate like oil or water or, like Germany and France, go to war again. This was the reason why the European Economic Community and its successor, the European Union, were created. Yet here we are, working long hours in jobs that we have difficulty explaining to children whose common-sense idea of meaningful work is growing or raising food (farming). That, too, in an economy that creates enormous disparities in outcomes for people—particularly those for men versus women.

One of the most startling qualities of the Wendat, for example, was the freedoms afforded to all regardless of sex. The French were astonished to learn how freely women could secure a divorce or change affiliation. This is important because communities are self-similar. If we create disparities in power within a household, they will replicate into the community and manifest as that community's behavior beyond it in interactions with other communities and with the Ecology.

Within our indigenous communities, there was no such animus. Primarily, I think, because they understood the very obvious and 'common-sense' fact that women are critical to the persistence of a community. The plain idea that had Mary Shelley rolling her eyes and founding an entire genre: ironically, male-dominated science fiction.

Neither within our indigenous American communities was there any framework for exerting coercive power, nor was there any means or desire to project it outwardly. The boundedness of a tribe allows for discussion and the formulation of consensus. The details of a matter are transparently assessed, and together, the tribe creates a solution for a challenge. Even crimes such as murder required reparations to be made collectively, as if to stake the community to the persistence of a meaningful, long-lasted reconciliation. Information had currency, and it was worn on the sleeve. Disclosure did not have to be demanded by an individual in a relevant circumstance—it was common sense that transparency was required to generate a fair outcome that would have resilience.


## Virtue
Going back to the useful properties, also known as virtues of being constituted with anima: aspects which make intelligence a creative and resilient, life-giving:

- **A Connection:** A shared notion of commitment
- **Empathy:** An understanding of the 'other,' distinct from oneself
- **Shared 'Clock':** A shared sense of what time is and how it is to be valued
- **Memory:** A shared, immutable, and transparent ledger of truth
- **Shared Purpose:** From many, we become one or *E Pluribus Unum*.

You may discern that without explicit statement, it presents itself as an idea that has **boundedness**. Like Earth itself, it is finite and whole, and what is unique about it is that it has infinite potentiality. In fact, intelligence is the planet rendered virtually, and what we see on Earth is that intelligence manifested as truth and beauty—a reality that works.

If it does not work, it is because that intelligence lacks a mechanism to distribute its value transparently and naturally. Something by which we many may become one. Because virtual, all is or is not. We are either all in or we will be all out, and it's just a question of time. This is why the view of the earth from the moon had such a striking impact on the first astronauts. It was finite. We were infinite in faculty *E Pluribus Unum*.

If it does not work, it is because that intelligence lacks a mechanism to distribute its value transparently and naturally. Something by which we many may become one. Because virtual, all is or is not. We are either all in or we will be all out, and it's just a question of time. *E Pluribus Unum*.

**RISC = Reduced Instruction Set Computer. Call this a rationalized operating system; a 'smart-contract' enabled to pair-off or 'level' countervailing instructions to recover value lost as a negative externality (heat, particulate emission, noise), all of which serve to bring forward end-of-life and inflate costs.*
