**Artwork**: *Like A Roiling Stone* - This is an abstract expression of wholeness as *digital* non-dualism - a decimal point is followed by a zero (nothing subtracted) *or* alternatively the seer perceiving the universal as indistinct from self (nothing added). Important here is the distinction between hole and whole - the former is the void null abyss of nihilism (an absence of all things) while the latter is a full accounting of *all* things brought into equilibrium where time is Universal and settled. Therefore it has a return on investment (*Roi*) manifested through the settling of its element (Londinium) through contemplation. Through being, the self is transformed, and so to *perhaps* the whole in good time. One's sovereignty has been assumed (taken - never shaken - and quite often -  stirred).

**The Whole Truth** 

*Some say that we are players Some say that we are pawns But we've been making money Since the day that we were born... ...And we're praying it's not too late 'Cause we know we're falling from grace Millennium* 

~ Robbie Williams ([Millennium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xcWOviMI6Lk))

In our world today, material risks—to our climate, socio-political economy, and ultimately, our security—*multiply* exponentially. Paradoxically, managing these requires us to adopt the principle of infinite *divisibility* as we aim to husband the planet's finite resources without debasement. This perspective offers a *bounded* metric for gauging the relative value of things, including creative work so that we may prioritize our opportunities and risks effectively. Moreover, it denominates our global economy with a notional unit that may be used to autonomously manages the supply and demand of capital (essentially data) with credible neutrality.

I have created a series of essay that aim to explain in plain and meaningful terms emergent technologies and their relevance to problems humanity faces in the modern world. Together they tie threads that I've explored as a intellectual and professional:

1. [**Sine Qua No**](https://transition-insight.com/?blogcategory=Sine+Qua+Non+(Intelligence))**n** (Intelligence) explores emergent information technologies at an abstract level drawing from ethics, philosophy and the social sciences that lend themselves over time to becoming intelligence imbued on a network (Turing-completeness).

2*.* [**E Pluribus Unum**](https://transition-insight.com/?blogcategory=E+Pluribus+Unum+(Capital)) (Capital) weaves insights from the social sciences and from my own experiences in software engineering delivery and governance (project/program management) to explain capital, and in particular its notional aspect, money.

3. [**Regnum Dei**](https://transition-insight.com/?blogcategory=Regnum+Dei+(Good+Governance))  (Divine Governance) integrates multidisciplinary insights to explain capital — especially its notional form: money. Here, *Divine* refers to the alignment of objective fact (truth) and rational design (beauty); to divine is to *define* a bounded ideal to serve as an aim or objective. Money's primary quality for divining opportunities is that it can be used to express the price/value/cost of creativity (including Creation's) in fungible terms as yield (definitive comparative value).

- **Dial Square**: Introduces a framework or myth model that explores the concept of relative value in a network. It has three components: Square (embodiment), Dial (derivation of value through currency/resonance), and the Yoga Element (assessment of equivalence that lends value a fungible, i.e. widely accepted metric).
- **Sophia Prima**: Asks what basic truths do we all *know* and accept to be true as foundation for consensus (as a starting point for ideal vectors and defining incentive-driven behaviour for an identity and in a commonwealth). These are models to drive automaticity (anarchy) and bridge the space between *the* existential dichotomy: theosophical (variety of experience) and philosophical (scientific inquiry)*
-  **Policia** (Prospective and TBD): Defines and models governance apparatus—legislative or representative as well policy priorities and approaches. This is a speculative space shaped by the potential of information technologies that, while mature in other domains (e.g., secure data transmission), remain largely unadopted in monetary and fiscal regimes. This lag persists due to the entrenchment of obsolete institutional modes. Adoption may allow in fact obviate the need for discussion as policy 'falls out' naturally as a result of tighter monetary governance and transparent yield expression.

These draw on millennia of human creativity to examine the central phenomena of the late 20th century and this new millennium: the rise of the virtual machine— the planet's central nervous system and core utility— the internet. The internet’s evolution now culminates in the emergence of proof-of-stake public blockchain protocols, which promise to finally make it a safe, secure space for our social, economic, and political lives.

These protocols enable the reconciliation of public and private keys and thus the alignment of public and private interests. They give us the capacity to assess risk and opportunity holistically, down to the fundamental unit of analysis: the abstracted identity of a single human. As modern technological successors to ancient systems of governance, these protocols allow us to properly assess value and assert price—including the price of time itself, measured as the opportunity cost of deferring consumption to secure that public network. The adoption and scaling of emergent technologies, such as proof of stake transaction protocols that instantiate relative productivity (as yield), is a vital foundation for managing the complexities of modern risk; one we must begin earnestly.

I'll continue to explore these themes, especially the expression of organizational policy through incentives used in tandem with approaches to governance that enable autonomy while aligning private and public interests to generate net-positive outcomes. These involve a reductive process of simplifying legal and accounting frameworks to dovetail with the emergence of secure fiat and smart contract enabled distributed applications. 

*Also framed as Nature/Nurture, Romantic/Rational, Faith/Science, Church/State or my favourite lens God/Caesar (Creation/Commons - which I particularly love because it offers up 'creativity' as the connective tissue and current). The idea is to parse and pair and reconcile this schism in a relatively non-contentious way as a sound footing for non-coercive governance.
