### The Principle of Decamerons 旬

The core of this system is the division of the month into three distinct 10-day segments, or **Decamerons**. These are not just time periods but phases of a cycle.

- **The First Decameron (Days 1-10):** Represents the beginning of a cycle. It's a phase of newness and potential.
- **The Second Decameron (Days 11-20):** Represents the middle, a period of consolidation and continuation.
- **The Third Decameron (Days 21-30/31):** Represents the end of the cycle, and the user's interpretation, the **open segment of the character 月**. This is the most crucial phase, as it holds the most weight for the next cycle due to **recency bias**.

When the third *decameron* closes you have sight (vision) on forward progression. The Japanese character and the word for seeing (見える) literally gives you a view on forward momentum or progress - an eye with legs.

This framework allows for the tracking of behavioral trends over time and, is a fractal expressing in larger terms on life stages (Acts I, II, III)

### Rules for Behavioral Tracking

The system operates on a simple "two-of-three" rule set to determine a trend. You track whether a daily activity occurs within each of the three Decamerons.


#### Rule 1: The "Two-of-Three" Trend

If a daily activity (e.g., exercise, meditation, healthy eating) occurs in at least **two of the three** Decamerons in a given month, you have successfully established a **positive trend**. This indicates consistency and mastery of the behavior.

- **Example A:** You meditate regularly in Decamerons 1 and 2, but not in 3. You have still established the behavior for the month.
- **Example B:** You meditate regularly in Decamerons 2 and 3, but not in 1. This is a very strong signal of a newly established trend due to the **recency bias**.



#### Rule 2: The "One-of-Three" Variance

If a behavior only occurs in **one of the three** Decamerons, it is considered a **variance**—a departure from the norm or a new, unestablished activity. This could signal either a positive development (the start of a new habit) or a negative one (a lapse in an old one).



#### Rule 3: The Recency Bias (The Bias for Newness)

The third and most recent Decameron holds the most significance. An activity or trend established in the final segment carries more momentum and is a stronger predictor of future behavior. This **bias for newness** is a key rule for:

- **Driving out Behavior:** If a negative activity (e.g., late-night screen time) occurs in Decameron 1 but is absent in Decamerons 2 and 3, the behavior is actively being "driven out." The recency bias validates the success of this trend.
- **Setting a Trend:** A new positive behavior that is established in Decameron 3 is a powerful signal that it will continue into the next monthly cycle.

### A More Appropriate Framing

The initial framing is good, but to make the algorithm more actionable, let's refine the definitions:

- **Red (Opportunity):** Let's call this **Growth**. This category represents innovation, learning, and expansion. These tasks are not urgent but are essential for long-term progress. Think: learning a new skill, creating a new product, or exploring an untested idea.
- **Hot (Yellow - Risk):** Let's call this **Resolution**. This category is about addressing problems, risks, or issues that, if left unresolved, will cause greater harm. These tasks are high-priority. Think: fixing a bug in code, resolving a conflict, or managing a financial risk.
- **Blue (Substance):** Let's call this **Foundation**. These are the core, non-negotiable activities that maintain the system. They are the base upon which all other activities are built. Think: daily exercise, consistent meditation, or routine administrative work.

### The Decameron Algorithm

This algorithm processes your daily backlog and prioritizes your actions over a 10-day cycle.

**Step 1: Categorization** Each item in your backlog must be assigned one of the three color codes (Red, Yellow, or Blue) based on the definitions above.

**Step 2: Prioritization and Execution** Within each 10-day Decameron, tasks are prioritized in the following order to ensure an optimal balance of stability, maintenance, and growth:

1. **Yellow (Resolution):** All Yellow tasks must be completed first. These address risk and prevent future problems. They are the highest priority.
2. **Blue (Foundation):** Once Yellow tasks are addressed, you focus on your Blue tasks. These are the daily or routine activities that must be completed to maintain your base level of productivity and well-being.
3. **Red (Growth):** After Yellow and Blue tasks are complete, any remaining energy or time is allocated to Red tasks. These are your stretch goals.

**Step 3: Analysis and Ratio** At the end of the Decameron, the algorithm produces a measurable output: the ratio of tasks completed. For example, a **Red:Yellow:Blue ratio** of 2:1:5 shows that you completed 2 growth tasks, 1 resolution task, and 5 foundation tasks. This ratio provides a quantifiable snapshot of your focus.

### The Self-Similar Structure (The Year)

The Decameron algorithm can be applied recursively to larger cycles, creating a self-similar, hierarchical system for the year.

1. **The Month:** A month consists of three Decamerons. The ratio from the final Decameron of the month (Decameron 3) holds the most weight due to recency bias. You then generate a cumulative monthly ratio.
2. **The Quarterly Trine:** A year is made up of three four-month segments. Let's call each segment a **Quarterly Trine**.
3. **The Year:** The monthly ratio for each of the three Decamerons within a Quarterly Trine is combined to create a Trine ratio. The three Quarterly Trine ratios then provide a complete picture of the year's momentum.
