<p>Original name of Arsenal. Perhaps the first instance of the word, a workshop or factory for the forging of weaponry situated in London. The word derived from the Arabic <strong>dār aṣ-ṣināʿah</strong> (دار الصناعة) means house of manufacture or workshop. Workers (labourers and management) created Dial Square - a football club - to express something more creative at play as the modern game developed into what is has become. Dial Square is a sundial and is used as a metaphor to represent an identity's unique attribute in place and time (making it constant but distinct in Calling and opportunity) through a semantic perimeter of identity embodied.</p>
