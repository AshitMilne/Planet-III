Notionally this is food. It needs to be eaten, planted as seed or tended as cattle. It spoils if stockpiled or neglected: it will be subject to debasement or become available for illicit and/or unethical behaviour. Paper cash has this quality. Like crop and husbandry money requires a boundary in order to be well-governed. This boundary forms a Commons or a Sovereign jurisdiction and the 'crop's yield maybe seen as the 'risk-free' rate.
