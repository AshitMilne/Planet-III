The masculine aspect of the feminine. Hostile and defensive shorn of all its defenses and left bereft of true fathers and sons. It knows no peace without war. It wants and needs to see the bad in everyone. It animates the Hegemon (Caesar) and its scapegoat agents in community. It pulls us back through fear, panic, vanity and prejudice  in the days Christ Consciousness arises. When the message that aligns us to Creation has clarity of signal it responds with chaos and decadent promise.
