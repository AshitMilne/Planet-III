A philosophy of reducing ownership of property to a subjective level of genuine comfort and ease that is naturally sparse over time, drawing little from the commons or creation as no substantial distinction is made between needs and wants. Associated instead is an appreciation of intimate connection to nature, community, culture, play and, through introspection, oneself.
