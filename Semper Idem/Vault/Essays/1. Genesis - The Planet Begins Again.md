## The Reckoning

Dedicated to all you
All human beings

Because we separate
Like ripples on a blank shore
Because we separate (In rainbows)
Like ripples on a blank shore (In rainbows)

Many of us, while preoccupied with our own progress in life—the dichotomy of being and becoming versions of ourselves that might coexist more comfortably with our conscience with each step taken—also watch carefully the broad sweep of human behaviour in a global setting. Amidst the seeming [[entropy]] and apparent chaos, our imaginations have been captured by the evolution of [[information technology]], and in particular the imagined promise of a (beautiful) reckoning: not a fearsome retribution, but rather a reconciliation of the self to the [[commons]] (the structures we establish to govern ourselves), and thence to creation.

Perhaps the first complex civilization to linguistically capture this challenge in universally accessible terms is that of the East. The Japanese characters for 'China' represent that country on its own terms as two characters, together constituting the term 'Middle Kingdom'—an administrative artifice occupying a realm between the earth (where the self dwells) and heaven (or creation).

I interpret the first character to represent the coming together of two parties for some reason, whether it be an atomistic transaction between two strangers in complex society or the breaking of bread between kindred spirits. The transaction involves a splitting of something into two halves (incidentally, that thing may be turned to represent the Japanese character for 'Day'). However, that split extends beyond the thing being shared, and the implication—for me at least—is that something substantial is manifested outside that immediate transaction: a ripple into the [[commons]] and into creation that must be accounted for. The second character represents Kingdom or Country—the [[commons]] or [[commonwealth]], if you will. It is bounded, and within it you see the three tiers joined, representing the need for a constitution that reconciles them even as it allows for the daub of a transaction in the space between self and the [[commons]]. With complexity came the need to create an *allowance* or an ideation of the value exchanged—money. It is no coincidence that this money has at times in English been known as a sovereign, for it is the sovereign or [[commonwealth]] whose responsibility it has been to administer it for the collection of souls who live within its boundaries.

As we've evolved in our systems of governance through the ages, the overriding challenge has been for the [[commonwealth]], or a sovereign, to coexist and relate to others with whom it shares creation (the planet) without degrading the whole. This is a macro imperative mirroring our personal reality, as each of us, in relative states of awareness, seeks to understand what constitutes an ethical life lived in equilibrium—a sane and objective measure of comfort that does not, in turn, yield discomfort for the [[commonwealth]] or for the planet, or creation, beyond it.

Starting from the vantage of survival and subsistence, creative effort yields comfort (food and shelter). Over time, however, our basic needs are easily met and exceeded, to a point at which returns begin to diminish, and arguably have been qualitatively negative. Quantitatively, the things we own end up owning us, sapping our psychic energy; we literally become sick with the consequences of our excessive action. This has been a theme in spiritual and transcendental thought, through Christ and the Buddha Siddhartha, and on to the American transcendentalists Whitman, Emerson, and Thoreau, who, before the closing of the frontier, would have discerned a native and tribal way to be with the world and to still be of it. Quite often the answer was the sannyasin’s renunciation of worldly preoccupation, if only briefly, to carve out the essentials of what it means to simply be.

Thoreau, who had retired to Walden to become a jack of all the required 'trades' necessary to front the essentials of life, commented on the incessant and excessive noise generated *à la mode*—fashions incessantly cycled to generate artificial demand for the professional or the specialist. The accumulation and preoccupation with things is accompanied by a degradation in our relationships to one another, and by extension, to our communities and institutions. This [[anti-heritage]] weighs on our emotional and physical wellbeing, and, of course, the aggregate outcome is a degradation of our planet itself—the tragedy of the [[commons]] on a global scale. This was called out in 1962 by Rachel Carson in [Silent Spring](https://www.rachelcarson.org/silent-spring) as a hubristic separation from nature—our inability as a species to align our self-interest with those of the [[commonwealth]], other species, and the planet itself.



## The World Wakes Up From History

In my own life the year of magic will forever be 1989 when I stood at the threshold of becoming a man. Twenty years on from the summer of '69 when I was born, the air appeared lit with incessant warmth and sunshine; I saw the good in everyone. That optimism was reflected broadly in the pivot in English music away from the maudlin dulcet tones of my teenaged years; an inheritance of the mod and punk of my early childhood, in its place now was the ecstatic rave euphoria of a primal scream launched with fever pitch, promising a life filled with Happy Mondays. Bryter Layter had become Kula Shaker, and the air reverberated with pop piety and praise - a savvy and refined style infused with good taste *and* good vibes. We cheered and celebrated the promise of a bounty - a dividend with peace its mid-wife, just as our flowerchild forbears now in mid-life once protested with derision and division their war-torn strife.

It was up for grabs now or so it appeared.  Human arrangements writ large no longer looked a fraught and tenuous round peg in a square hole but rather a whole that may yet be dialed into a square meal and fair deal. In real terms the Berlin Wall came down and in South Africa, Nelson Mandela held captive for twenty-five years, was finally free. To those of us, students of history and political science the long march to freedom had begun. I was on my way towards a career in law or diplomacy - arenas whose quality depend on the veracity *and* fidelity of the confluence of signals being transmitted and received by participants in the system of governance they comprise. Reality bit when I got a look into those fields at graduate school and as well whilst travelling and living abroad. Seeing limited scope for impact in the civil service or in the courts I switched and began a career in [[information technology]] at *the* great 20th century corporate behemoth - IBM.

Dialing back to the early 1990s though, the internet still unseen and unheard of by most had nonetheless begun its evolution towards the indispensable utility it is now. It began as a US Department of Defense project to allow decentralized, fault tolerant, signal transmission between parties without a fixed dedicated and persistent contiguous line. Data could now be transmitted between individuals and groups in packets sent out and then reconstituted at their destination reducing by orders of magnitude the [[coordination]] required to facilitate network traffic. As networks and the protocols used for transmitting traffic matured they of course allowed for the delivery of ever more sophisticated multimedia content - graphics, images, audio, video with ever higher fidelity to become the internet we now know today. It was no longer a difficult thing to get an alternative view of reality - one that wasn't filtered through the sovereign or the delegates to which it had deferred the manufacturing of consent - the overarching narrative they assiduously cultivate and massage to manage their multitudes. This extended to an opinion on what constituted a fair price for things of value at any given moment - opinions which in the aggregate constitute objective [[consensus]]. In regimes that lack comprehensive legitimacy, alternative 'black' markets for good and services, and indeed alternative currencies, appear. In 2008, a global black market for a new global reserve, i.e. a new version of the dollar appeared and its name was [[Bitcoin]]. On the 5 October 2009 a single [[Bitcoin]] was worth $0.00076 - that token is now valued at over $116,000. The [[emergence]] of this decentralized currency along with yet another bailout forced me to into a personal reckoning; I began to re-examine my life and my career. The whole point of managing software delivery was to contain risk to capital - the triple constraints of scope, time and money. Scope was always dictated by revenue and if revenue was to be denominated in a currency of no apparent value, then what was the point of managing an 'enterprise' project? All that really mattered was how I used that truly scarce commodity - *my own* time on earth. I started Transition Insight in 2010 and continued my career now as an independent contractor usually working on digital identity and wallet initiatives with smaller more nimble teams applying agile methods. All the while I continued to explore the broader implications of that tumultuous year 2008 - and watch the evolution of legitimate money.



## Le Prix: The Genesis of Legitimate Global Consensus

Life's rich demand creates supply in the hand

Of the powers, the only vote that matters
Silence means security, silence means approval
On Zenith on the TV, tiger run around the tree
Follow the leader, run and turn into butter
Let's begin again, begin the begin
Let's begin again like Martin Luther Zen
The mythology begins the begin

~ R.E.M. ([Begin The Begin](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfVvgQb6MC8))

As I geared up to complete a decade at IBM in the midst of the great financial crisis, [[Bitcoin]] emerged and we began to begin again—like Martin Luther and Zen mythology in times past. My own feeling is that Satoshi is not so much a Zen master sensei and practitioner (of what I imagine to be a reverse-engineered protocol) but an imagined mark or destination. ‘He’ represents an imagined universally applicable philosophical model reduced to an algorithm and protocol that sets out a notion of what is relatively valuable to *humans* in the marketplace of *ideas*. He represents humanist self-sovereignty—at a minimum the capacity to live and let live (or leave) and where possible he seeks through example to be the servant leader our times call for.

This was a palliative at a time when markets—and indeed our civilization—entirely untethered from the imperfect anchor of Bretton Woods, listed badly and tilted into the abyss of ever more apparent chaos. On the sheer cliff of Half Dome duality that modern egoism had wrought, Satoshi was a hook well tethered, and the nascent blockchain of transactions on the [[Bitcoin]] network the solidly braided thread that might lead us out of the morass—an objective ordering of transactions that are at least governed by the rigour of mathematics, if not by humans who claim to use maths to order and govern society and political economy. It was at least orderly—as though we had relearned how to patiently keep calm and queue for things we wanted (even if they were still absurd—a murderer’s golf clubs, for example, or miraculous images on pieces of toast).

[[Bitcoin]] itself emerged from our general capacity to discern trends, fads, and zeitgeist preoccupations among those of us who feel the need to connect to the world beyond our narrow day-to-day lives. In what now resembles Marshall McLuhan's [[Global Village]], with a handful of central narratives holding sway over collective consciousness, those trends encompass our preoccupation with finding meaning in our lives and our search for opportunities to fill our lives with substance (however we each define opportunity and substance). We are—and have been from the beginning—social animals, looking toward a [[consensus]] to dictate who we should be and what we should do with ourselves. Among us are also those who make an entire life out of seeking, whose ambition is to be a seer of potentialities not yet imagined—to spot something *everyone* will come to see as an improvement in our condition, and then make the case to develop a [[consensus]] on the matter. To do so is to lead by example through service to oneself in a way that actualizes welfare broadly throughout a [[commonwealth]].

Deeply held narratives concerning reality are not easily moved, but on one thing there is universal acknowledgment: things of value are the outcome of *creative* expression. Value is expressed as a relative valuation, or a price. But in this moment, to create—what exactly? And how, for whom, and why? To answer that question through a holistically coordinated price is the prize. The surcharge (the cost of something in excess of something else) is, in fact, the surprise—a valuation prised out of a *collective* world that is an oyster. This surcharge isn’t a simple extra fee; rather, it reflects a deeper, more profound value that wasn’t immediately obvious but is credible because it has global [[consensus]] backing it. That [[consensus]] is derived through [[coordination]] whose legitimacy is automatic—namely, it amounts to *[[ordination]]*.

The French term *[[ordinateur]]*, coined by IBM (France) in 1955 as a translation for the English word “computer,” implies a systemic approach to calculation—emphasizing [[coordination]] and coherence to achieve a collective outcome, rather than [[brute-force derivation]] (as is the case with [[Bitcoin]]). Reliance on brute-force methods introduces pathological biases and inefficiencies, where the costs of such an approach far outweigh the returns. In short, this is to create a world in which ‘might *always* makes right,’ and in which a regime hegemon will claim, ‘you’re either with us or against us.’

In contrast to this are notions of ethics. The idea that even trying to choose between the world (or God, or creation) and one’s country is hopeless, futile, and misses the point of the exercise—that is, to live a good life. Implicit in the word *[[ordinateur]]* is this notion, and it was a thoughtful response in the aftermath of World War II and a complicity in business done with western governments who, through the give-and-take of realpolitik over the centuries, had exacted enormous suffering on a stateless minority. Examining *[[ordinateur]]* in English, we have *ordination* or *[[ordinance]]*:

1. **The act of conferring holy orders**, such as ordaining someone as a rabbi.
2. **The act of arranging or organizing systematically**, for example the insertion at relevant points of secure nodes to verify and validate transactional behaviour, and as a counterweight to brute-force bias in system design, triage, and other forms of decision-making.
3. **A law or decree** enacted and enforced by a local (i.e., decentralized) government, such as a city council or county board. It is a type of regulation that governs matters specific to a particular jurisdiction and generally covers topics not already addressed by other layers of governance—state or federal laws.

[[Bitcoin]] is dumb money. What distinguishes it is that it simply works better than existing fiat currencies, much the same way as a dumb terminal is a ‘better’ word processor than a typewriter—even the electric Olympus I brought to my first year at Western was no match for the 286 IBM clone I finished that year with. Who is doing the processing, and to what end? Money will not—and cannot—dictate *unless* there is a price for the time spent at that terminal. Any creative endeavour that is to be held accountable for its impact on the [[commonwealth]] or creation must therefore express yield that is surplus to the cost paid in time by the self, those [[commons]], and creation (as with a negative externality). This is imperative to secure the life and liberty of the self—most of all those most vulnerable in any state of order that may be called ‘civil.’

As well, what may be called civil is that which seeks to bring about equity or equality. Whether that is manifested by allowing, say, women into combat roles or removing men from them is the matter at hand; where is the philosophical model that underscores intelligence for people who approach this question with common sense in a world after Nagasaki?

Amidst the seeming entropy and apparent chaos of the world as it is, our imaginations reckon that an anarchic truth of connective tissue may yet be discerned and persisted in a comprehensive network where capital in all its forms is notionally well-represented and well-governed, and so *universally* acknowledged as not only legal tender but also as legitimately tendered. Nothing in life is free except information—looking out the window, one sees it is all there, nothing lacking, and no one should be left wanting.
