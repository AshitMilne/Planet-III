# **Glossary**

## A

**Act III**
A third 'elder' phase of life forward-looking and committed to the future synthesizes prior reflection (a cycling of apprehension and introversion) to apply semper idem to societal evolution.

**Anarchy**
An emergent and dynamic order, manifesting without centralized coordination through a network or ecology through identification of objective truth and aesthetic (minimal) purpose or utility in a specific context. It contrasts with chaos: a self-evident disorder and incongruity.

**Anti-heritage**
 The accumulation of material or cultural preoccupations that degrade emotional, social, or environmental well-being; the erosion of relationships and institutions through overconsumption or neglect of ethical equilibrium.

------

## B

**Bitcoin**
 A decentralized digital currency and transaction protocol that emerged in 2009, serving as a model for objective ordering of value and coordination beyond traditional sovereign-controlled monetary systems.

**Brute-force derivation**
 A computational or systemic approach relying on exhaustive trial-and-error rather than coordinated, ethical, or principle-driven design. In the essay, this is contrasted with holistic, coordinated approaches to value and governance.

------

## C

**Commons**
 A structured set of shared and collectively owned resources, rules, and institutions through which individuals coexist and interact. Includes both societal governance structures and natural systems; the ethical anchor or stake for human coordination.

**Commonwealth**
Synonym for the Commons or commonweal. A structured set of shared resources, rules, and institutions through which individuals coexist and interact. Includes both societal governance structures and natural systems; the ethical anchor for human coordination. The addition of weal or wealth implies a currency of culture and its notional equivalent, money is in common use, cycling continuously through it.

**Consciousness**
A state of awareness tied to the idea of a universal or divine mind particularly in states of 'flow' wherein one is deeply immersed in the current - a manifestation that is both both instant and constant.

**Consensus**
 A collectively derived agreement or valuation that has legitimacy because it reflects coordination among participants, rather than merely imposed authority. In the essay, this extends to global or networked systems such as blockchain or collective human judgment.

**Coordination**
 The process of aligning individual actions, intentions, or contributions to produce a coherent and ethical outcome for the self, commons, or creation.

------

## E

**Emergence**
 The appearance of patterns, value, or behavior from interactions among actors or systems, often unpredictable but manifesting as meaningful structures in society or nature.

**Entropy**
 Complexity or apparent chaos in human, societal, or systemic behavior. Not simply disorder, but the fragmentation that provides the substrate for new patterns, coordination, and creative opportunity.

## G

**Genesis**
 The starting point of coordinated renewal; the conceptual origin of Act III and the essay’s broader exploration of legitimacy, value, and ethical governance.

**Global Village**
 A term adapted from Marshall McLuhan, describing the networked state of human communication and awareness, where central narratives influence collective consciousness.

------

## I

**Information Technology (IT)**
The systems, protocols, and networks facilitating data transmission, computation, and coordination among individuals and institutions. In the essay, IT is positioned as a catalyst for societal evolution and the emergence of legitimate value systems.

**Intelligence**
A form of holistic and intentional agency that is systemically aware. It operates objectively (truth) and manifests aesthetic appeal  (beauty). As such it commands universal legitimacy. It is the seeker's objective.

**Identity Stack**
 A layered conceptual model of identity including cryptographic (wallets, blockchain), semantic (domains, digital handles, semper idem), and human (personal, social) layers, used to anchor ethical and coordinated action in digital systems. Metaphorically this is Dial Square

The metaphorical effect of individual or transactional action extending into the commons and creation, creating consequences beyond the immediate act.

**Regenerative Systems**

------

## V

**Via Negativa**
A method of problem-solving or improvement by the strategic removal of elements, specifically applied to governance, it would be to resolve the layering of constituents' needs that result from a subject's failure to distinguish their economic needs and wants from their responsibility to self, commons and ecology.

------

## Y
