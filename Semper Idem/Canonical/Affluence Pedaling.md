You say coke, I say 'caine
You say John, I say Wayne
Hot dog, I say cool it man
I don't wanna be the President of America

You say smile, I say cheese
Cartier, I say please
Income tax, I say Jesus
I don't wanna be a candidate
For Vietnam or Watergate
'Cause all I want to do is

Bicycle, bicycle, bicycle



###### **Anarchy Gains From Disorder**

Nicolas Nassim Taleb, a bicycle enthusiast, writes about the opportunities we miss in life to fulfill our ambitions because we fail to grasp opportunities because they don't look remotely like anything we'd desire. They are unseen pennies from heaven that if pocketed would actually have a yield. Forsaken, their compounded value is an impossible dream - wishful thinking - of what we might do if we were younger and if our health hadn't faltered. The basic things we once took for granted rapidly fall away and the ambition of answering our calling - or even discovering it - lies in a forlorn heap of regret as we yearn for the absolutely impossible - a 'do-over' - knowing that is the *one* thing nobody gets whatever their station in society.

 We're endowed with the innate capacity to conserve energy - the tendency to be comfortably at rest unless otherwise required. However, paired with the absent-minded short-termism and attention deficit of modern life we call a 'lack of presence', it becomes a disability.

In **Antifragile: Things That Gain from Disorder***,* Taleb critiques modern thoughtless versions of effort and health — a man hires a porter to carry his luggage, then goes to the gym to lift weights; like this we constantly forego opportunities to exert meaningful and useful labor and then artificially simulate it later in controlled, sterile environments. In contrast, as a kid arriving in Bombay from London in 1982 I'd stare at the sculpted construction workers rippling with muscle as they carried materiel up flights or even up makeshift bamboo ladders or scaffolding. With little in the way of 'safety material' - it was presence that propelled them lithely through the gears of their work.

All of us *want* to be fitter and better prepared for life. We also want greater agency- be free from the *need* to earn money. But there we are skipping an opportunity to 'lift' and then paying for gym memberships - not to mention the car that gets us there. 

You've no doubt heard of the phrase 'a penny saved is a penny earned'. Well, skip the penny altogether and work for the body and mind you want to live in - as much as possible without using (what passes for) money.

Elsewhere I express the idea of Original Sin wherein starting from a position of vulnerable innocence and we venture into space we occupy together, the Commons, to derive comfort which, comes at a cost to Creation. One that we then endeavor, quite rightly to collectively to contain because left unchecked they accumulate.

Anarchism starts at home in one's immediate circumstances where first some presence, and then vision and creativity yield opportunities as we look across our life experience holistically to gain optimal yield with minimum cost to others. I delve into this with Prima Sophia - a philosophical foundation for developing governance frameworks that that might incentivize and reward behavior that aligns the interests of the self with those of the commons, all the while paying down our debt to Creation.

**Back Pedaling**

In my own life, I have looked and felt the best when I've owned a bicycle and used it as my primary mode of transportation. After dropping off in fitness during my last year at Western (my first owning a car). I headed off to Japan where I whizzed through the streets of Wakayama City or sub-urban Tokyo (Kunitachi) in absolutely wicked shape. In between I was back on a bike at grad school in Ottawa coursing through the lanes that line the Rideau Canal with utter pleasure or tricking down campus steps to impress a girl climbing up them.

In technology credibility comes from longevity - the idea of Lindy - again popularized by Taleb. The bicycle has some serious Lindy as it's fundamentally unchanged since 1880s when John Kemp Starley invented the Rover Safety Bicycle (below). The predecessor was the rather more precarious [Penny Farthing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penny-farthing) or high-wheeler.

The bicycle is compact, with negligible additional footprint walked at your side, and smartly yields a personal boundary trailing behind you. My Babymaker's e-assist simplifies instrumentation, removing gears and their various moving parts while adding batteries to maintain cruising speed at grade variances - an excellent trade off: You should generally be walking up slopes you cannot ride up in your lowest gear. I'll explain.

ultimately you're using all fours when things get 'technical' and your going vertical; while in the intermediate range using hiking poles to spread work across all four limbs. A good heuristic for speed is how fast you can go — or want to go — while keeping your mouth closed and breathing only through your nose, which both filters* and throttles the air entering your body’s fuel system, encouraging fat-burn and over time reducing your body's demand for sugar (craving). Fat and protein are abundant relative to sugars and salt whose stores needs to be well-managed - they have potential shelf-life and are scarce - it's why they came to be used as money.

All physical preparedness protocols including the opportunistic involve developing both a capacity for acceleration as well as endurance. Life on earth requires both - and generally we don't run long distances - we walk them. Which brings us back to the sweet niche the bicycle fills for managing time and money - as well as satiating our impulse for thrill seeking safely.

In 2018 as a contract project manager I was back in my old building - where I had watched the TARP debates in the ground floor offices of IBM while on lunch - 120 Bloor West - but with BMO a few flights up. I decided to use the city's bike share and the 20-minutes each way as a complement to my tactical self-defense (Krav Maga) training.  After a few months the results were extraordinary.

In midst of COVID, I like many, was contemplating life and the sheer chaos beyond our front door. I began to pull several triggers to exit civil society (switching out of fiat-based assets to first Bitcoin then Ethereum as Beacon went live was one).

Another was to buy the bicycle you see above. The Babymaker by FLX is an electric-assist commuter. Post COVID I quit the corporate scene and have begun to make the transition to what I call Act III. My 2012 Tacoma has been sold and my BMW 650X-Country motorcycle - gone too are the costs associated with those. Other changes are coming as I tighten my financial outgoings to practically nil minus the whole foods I'm increasingly eating. Whether my Babymaker rides on a [Sportsmobile ](https://sportsmobile.com/)at some point in the future is anyone's guess. In the meantime it's my go-to mode for travel under 20 km.

All of this acquires me greater agency and autonomy where I am in my own circumstances - and ultimately benefits the commons in small but meaningful ways.  Perhaps most of all I'm marketing an 'option' and exercising it in real time. It's yours for the *taking*.
