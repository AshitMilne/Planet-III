Above: Life's a beach on earth and so is Karma. Peaches come from a can - they were put there by a man in a factory downtown. 'sex on a beach' is just a beverage made of alcoholic distilled peaches and OJ (probably just as well given the look of things on earth). Get a room.

You can lead a horse to water But you cannot make him drink You can own a man's whole work for life But you cannot make him think what you want You can tell them all a thousand lies But you don't own the world

Man you leave it all in pieces Let us all come and clean it up Love to see your name in the papers Like to hang out at your club Like to drive around in your silver car As if it were a cloud Like to call yourself a legend But if you were you wouldn't be that proud

**Our VolunTier versus Your HireArchy**

At some point this life of yours will involve opportunities that don't in any obviously material sense impact your own interests. It may however involve turning away from opportunities whose relative real value (growth and meaning through creative expression) is negligible and whose notional returns no longer feel legitimate; it is only the hypnotic allure of their *imagined* value in our collective psyche that props them up. 

Nobody needs to sell you on exercising your Calling in 'technical' ways; doing the things you were apparently born to do. For me that's governance; writing or speaking about it, modeling or architecting it, and delivering or executing it*

Anarchy takes legitimate credible authority seriously - so seriously that it's open enough to go straight to 'the authority' on a given point when it's objectively apparent that it is authoritative. In a world where everyone regardless of merit is given voice and space simultaneously the result is an incoherent cacophony which cancels any meaningful signal. So diluted is western liberal democracy that even its only symbolically performative moment—voting—is seen as the central utilitarian vehicle for democratic expression.

From the standpoint of efficacy, for example when you are trying to raise the living standards and social capabilities (literacy, numeracy etc.) technocratic authority has an enviable record versus democracy (China versus India being the obvious example). In fact democracy is what authoritarians point to when they think of chaos. Anarchy is what a 'genuine' monarch (an Alexander or Peter) dreams of - a world in which everyone behaves as they do - with legitimate, self-evident moral authority. In which all lead by serving and credibility is obvious. It doesn't need 'marketing'.

The paradox is that anarchy, which is radically functional in even its performative aspects is closer in spirit to monarchy that it is democracy. Whereas democracy advocates for one's rights and privileges (the right to peace order and government in exchange for voting every five years) the anarchist see only their obligation to create it through action for all.

What is the Sovereign's (Crown) primary responsibility? Janitor and caretaker I would argue. It takes out 'the trash' and keeps things tidy.

I would argue that this is how anarchy solves for the Tragedy of the Commons where democracy's ordinary stalwarts remain paralyzed or preoccupied with self-interest (the protection of 'my back yard' with some undefined margin), consumerism, and career advancement within legacy frameworks. They will argue that we have a HireArchy - a professional class of administrators for this. When those administrators cannot deliver, a change of shirts for genuine change

(that failure to look after the Crown's land because money - the primary contract is clearly broken - and the sovereign in its current mode has defaulted and is insolvent (literally incapable of 'solving' things); the saving you all scrape together to look after yourself in old age when you are decrepit and your children have left you is the flip side of our Crown's indebtedness. (Money is after all a Sovereign IOU).

The word 'Janitor' phonetically transcribes as  જાણીતો in Gujarati and it means 'known person' or 'someone familiar'. In England they use the word 'Caretaker' instead of janitor. Combine the two ideas and you get 'that familiar person that everyone knows who 'takes care' of the spaces we occupy in common (not your backyard). That sounds like a sovereign to me.

For me all work is 'government' work: A collective building guitars is really just a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in Creation's ministry of musical instruments operating as a customer-focused scrum team (i.e. empowered by objectives - creating quality and value that has 'market' traction and a return on investment (time and materials). They meet and deliver their requirements without a 'HireArchy' dictating administrivia. Each member VolunTiers (takes a turn to lead when the moment calls for it). That requires openness and a sense of freedom to be who they are in a community where they find true communion -  the result is extraordinarily creativity (and fun). That's how I think of things - that's why I'm an anarchist. I don't see the distinctions between terms like customer, client, citizen and counterparty - I can't draw them. I don't know how.

**Money is 'No Object'**

What do you do in the moment when 'money is no object'. That is to say it doesn't exist or nobody is going to pay you or the thing people call money may as well be 'gameboard' paraphernalia? Something worth while (no object) is done anyway. I took that literally yesterday

I arrived at the train station early yesterday to find the train was a few minutes late. Mine's a quite rural station in a small town (Acton) that is fastidiously clean and safe and the station is no exception. However I saw an opportunity and I took it. Setting my pack on the platform I walked back and forth across the platform scouring the ground for litter and managed to fill the seven or eight minutes before the train arrived. As tidy as it was, I managed to collect a fair wack of chip bags, cigarette butts, odd bits of polystyrene - various bits of synthetic waste and deposited it without much ceremony into waste bin. Most of the few people on the platform were staring into their phones. One woman smiled while watching me while. I smiled 'just cleaning up a bit while we wait'. 'I noticed' she smiled backed. And now there was 'no object' - everything was in it's right place.  Now *that* is money. A connection was made and as well a [transaction](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/the-self-sovereign-transaction), imparting value; that's a 'give and go' - nobody 'on the take' here. The price — a few spare minutes — was established automatically for a return on the investment of a slightly cleaner platform. I had the opportunity to measure the opportunity cost instantly versus say, checking out the latest inspiring posts on 'Extreme Ownership' (the ideas expounded never get old - not on LinkedIn at any rate) or scanning a thoughtful retrospective and examination of clean-up after Team America's Falooda fiasco (a misunderstanding concerning how the order was given or interpreted (or neither or perhaps even both), tempers flared, then it was all over the floor - went viral on Instagram). I made my decision and started the clean-up operation at Acton GO.

I went about the task in a matter of fact manner but it was both meaningful (had a result) and was dramatic and theatrical because I was dressed like a commuter and not like Alexis here doing community service in Schitt's Creek (below) - which was filmed not too far from where I live and grew up after arriving in Canada - the green band north of the city where towne and country meet.

This is known as 'propaganda of the deed' (and to be honest I'm a whole lot less theatrical in the way I go about it today than say five, ten or fifteen years ago when I was a 'brand new radical', throwing myself about in an effort to force people into taking a hard look at how they judge value (and values). It's one way in which anarchists  practice 'retail politics'.**

**You Just Haven't Earned It Yet Baby**

My own sense of realism about what we are has sharpened over the past two or three years. From a systems and architecture perspective—despite my optimism about human potential—the reality is that perhaps only one in ten thousand people have the capacity, and critically, the profound openness (which gives rise to creativity), to be positive change agents—let alone do the heavy lifting.

This is reflexive Pareto: 20% of the nodes yield 80% of the value. Within that top 20%, just 4% yield 64%—and often a single node is responsible for over 50%—over a series of iterations at the very least if not after the first (and we are well into the sixth series). That’s hard for most people to accept in a world where everyone believes they’re especially special or even just above average drivers but that’s how life unfolds on this planet. We recognize this to some degree - it's why, all else equal, we have different levels of real credibility instantiated for example as different prices for 'insurance', credit or even access, say, to the publicly accesses parts of smart spaces to wait (like the Royal York's lobby). The degree to which we are each trusted by one another is different - and that should makes sense. Where I differ perhaps is that with the exception of maybe five or six people - and I'm not even really sure about them - I've pretty assigned a zero-trust rating across the board and it will stay that way indefinitely. You just don't deliver incremental value in my world unless cash is involved - it's all about (your) money for you. 

Political-Economy is ultimately about government (public and private if you care to draw that distinction). There's an old saw, that asks: If economists know so much about money how come they're not rich? My corollary to which is: Never mind rich, why are they even 'salaried'? If you know government *and* money - you don't use other peoples' - you have your own. You reimagine, mint and then dispense it freely because it's better than what's currently available. That's what I am doing here in my work here. You are a legitimate sovereign - only if you care only for 'good shit' (genuine fertile ground) and 'the seed' (the 'young idea' of a beginner's mind ensconced in awareness in time and place). That's the aspirational target. You may as well aim at the mark and not just merely high. Aiming at the mark is dangerous - you could die (which is actually safer than the standard approach to 'living' these days - where people most certainly will die but appear oblivious of the fact and so spend their time as though they had unlimited quantities of it.

This realization has even shifted my technical thinking while I hasten to add that we are still one protocol-agnostic movement, keeping a view on the bridges that connect us. I'm now inclined toward relative centralization and credibility, rather than decentralization for its own sake - which will come as we foster (or rather restore) anarchist culture to humanity. Ask yourself, are you willing to submit to the natural order?

A huge hit in the UK - a country once insistent that culture be held up to high standards and its quality measured objectively using a half-decently democratic and accessible proxy for the NME (New Musical Express) - 'the wisdom of large numbers' as measured by how *invested* people were (a 'proof of stake' called sales data) in their music. We tuned into (the Crown's) BBC Radio One for the 'Top 30' every Sunday. Most English men and women my age will remember this song - the first I ever heard by a Canadian band. They went on to sing 'Black Stations White Stations' as we approached Orwell's 1984 - my first full year in British North America (Canada). Long after we're gone, either in the particular or as a collective, we will leave an echo of who we were. The truth won't hurt *you* but it will annihilate our kind unless we confront it squarely.

If you know government *and* money - you don't use other people's - you have your own. You reimagine, mint and then dispense it freely because it's better than what's currently available. That's what I am doing here in my work - and at the GO Station (read on). You are the legitimate sovereign - because you care only for 'good shit' (genuine fertile ground) and 'the seed' (the 'young idea' of a beginner's mind ensconced in awareness in time and place). That's the aspirational target. You may as well aim at the mark and not just merely high.

**Questions arise as to how much agency or deliberateness one truly has in life - especially in respect to the radical 'deed'. We all carry a 'dragon nature'—a kind of mutation that we must arrest, tame and ride to fulfill our destiny. Michael Phelps is a physical outlier, born with anatomical attributes he had little to do with beyond being successfully born. But what sets him apart isn’t just form—it’s how he chose to engage it: how he saw it, trained it, and applied it in the world. That’s what I mean by discovering one’s calling. It unfolds through time, introspection, and practice in the face of the public's hammer that hates a nail that sticks out (they'll hate you if you're clever though they'd despise a fool).

The *X-Men* mythos captures this tension well—how our innate gifts are often seen by others as illness or menace, precisely because they imply exceptionalism. My sense is that everyone is potentially exceptional at something—that impulse in which you hold reflexive Pareto absolute advantage. And even if we don’t discover it (because we won’t make the effort or let others hold us back from it), we’re still exceptionally fortunate to have been born human. Isn’t that enough of a gift, relatively speaking oh sentient one?

Now imagine a world where someone like Phelps is barred from competing because of his 'mutant' advantage—where exceptional ability is treated as unfair. That world isn’t far off, in an era where everyone wants to be *especially* special. It creates a new kind of existential threat—rooted in material insecurity and social envy. You see it everywhere - in the yearning everyone seems to have to employ domestics, or to own marginally superior ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits). Mark my words - comfort leads to discomfort in the particular and the collective. This is a slippery slope to mediocrity (mission accomplished and extinction (well ahead of schedule). The welfare state made sense to a von Bismarck but if Alex Honnold wants to free climb Half Dome, that's his business - does the 'nanny state' have the right to ban that behaviour - is it qualified to do so? You see his behaviour as an errant - but that is you - not him. He's in a space where living and dying is one journey - which it is (and it's his so perhaps you'd best mind your business).

My own response to this is a kind of reset or reboot: to radically centralize my life—*self-sovereignty* as foundation - holding up to the world the 'Blue Screen of Deaf' (sorry I can't hear you - I'll call you back). At first, this can be isolating. But over time, it opens into a path where kindred spirits appear. As I gather and own my data, and apply it using a personal philosophical model, the pattern becomes unmistakable. The content becomes cohesive—expressed in manifest ways. If I build it and it's good enough they will come. Life’s too short to let just anyone live in it. At work, at rest, or at play.
