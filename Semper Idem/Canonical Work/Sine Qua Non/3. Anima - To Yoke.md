## Introduction ##

अचिन्त्य भेदाभेद तत्त्व
Like the flower and the scent of summer
like the sun and shine
Well the truth may come in strange disguises
Send the message to your mind.
~ Kula Shaker (Tattva)

Machina *before* humanity was the world as an 'OK' Computer - God's idea. The discussion mudra was the unseen and unspoken intelligence that flowed freely in abundance: A force of nature to make life on this third stone satellite a reality. It was one with God deeply embedded within *before* the complexity of civilization began to arise. Anima is a *human* idea that separates and categorizes to understand and model the universe but without a notional wholeness that is too complex and particulate to fully apprehend (Deus en Machina). The risk is that of course that the compelling model becomes the singular prism through which we see reality. Understanding that there is a (holy) ghost in the machine is critical. Mary Shelly the daughter of anarchist (or radical) parents William Godwin and Mary Wollstonecraft wrote Frankenstein's Monster which in *summary* amounts to this: the whole is not the sum of some ordinarily random parts assembled in an accustomed manner. Now, London could be a dangerously bleak place in *those* times especially. The darker side of that freedom is that denizens of some quarters were left to their own devices and without the social safety net of the welfare state that emerged by the time I was born in a corner of East London, a spiral set off by a series of unfortunate circumstances might leave a person with few options but part with a stake - a kidney perhaps. The cruel calculus is hard to swallow but plausible: donated limbs and organs 'harvested' increase the take value of a beggar on the street. That's the crude arithmetic of maximal revenue where the sum is greater than its parts. You don't want to believe that it happens and I don't want to live in a world where I imagine someone executing the business model.

The line from the Bard was 'What *a* piece of work is man'. Have you ever marvelled at a tailor's work? It is something to cut and assemble material well - no small project if done with care so as not to waste fabric. Owning an off-the-shelf suit that fits as well a Banana Republic makes them is enough of a flex for me. Having already bought it, I'll care for it and wear it for the practical thing a suit is.

Shelley's larger point was perhaps a different one: we *already* have machines to make men (and they are called mothers) so why go to the trouble of using weird science for the purpose? She presaged Nietzsche's more masculine version of the same message. We have replaced God or rather put ourselves in his place: 'We'll take it from here Thanks'. It was a salient argument in the age of autonomous engines (man-made machines) such as those weaving fabric in Blake's dark satanic mills and moving locomotive engines that had us suddenly realizing we had to account in our schedules for the variances between solar and clock time even in the short space between say London and Greenwich - now essentially the same place.

The point was this: 'How *much* abundance is enough?' And how particular and precise do you want to be about practical results and getting somewhere? At what point does 'research and development' become a flex? It is so absurd a question as to posit its own answer: The truth is that the cast was dyed in the wool and the wolf that came in from became friend and shepherd. The Lion, or as close as there was to one in a country already shorn of them for 10,000, years already lay with lambs and *we* in our Eden or rather *New Jerusalem* made it so. Is that not enough?

This conversation is about intelligence and technology - and not about how to get 'clever' with bad money governed poorly in the totality of our realm *Regnum Dei*. On the matter of technology ask why authors centuries on from Mary Shelley print on paper that might still be trees. 

As an anarchist I dream of trees and even beautiful giant stones - I'll show you one in Algonquin that is miraculously huge - the size of a house and straddled with white quartz. I've read Edward Abbey and I don't need the Moab to understand him. Why all these maddening crowds with their incessant noise? These were questions that the transcendentalists were asking almost 200 years ago and ones to which we are still trying to finesse an answer because everything is a priority.

Now I ask you, If I think I am privileged because I am not forced to surrender a kidney or lung then what do you suppose I should think of a three-hour commute to what David Graeber considers a bullshit job? One that now offers little opportunity for personal growth and that has me wasting energy in pursuit of things I do not want. And what should I think of the vast majority who still continuously toil? It's not much their pointless effort and time - that's there's to use as they see fit - but the destruction they are manifesting through it to what we share. Even as I glimpse the prospect of a new approach to order - a way out of our morass -  so many others are determined through inertia to stay in a groove driving an ever deeper scar into the planet. This is difficult to accept and live with.

 

## Paranoid Android ##

Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing, Gucci, little piggy
~ Radiohead (Paranoid Android)

As we hive off into communities male and female aspects of a society perform different roles. The feminine aspect of man (anima) is that which will listen and discuss to yolk community rather than immediately resort to force to aggrandize. The male aspect of the female (animus) meanwhile looks to keep and hold what has already been secured, fearful that coercion and force will one day leave offspring wanting lest the patriarch *compromises* through transactional behaviour which structurally undermines the collective her matriarchy has nursed into being with care in the household. This is the inner tension in our collective with which we struggle as we simultaneously reconcile it with its reciprocal personality in the 'other'. These internal machinations are the paranoid android of panic and fear or alternatively pride and prejudice. The contemplative seeks to overcome this negativity by emanating the positive and constructive elements of Anima - intelligence without without which a personality risks being swept up by animus which represents emotion that is hostile or defensiveness. 

Anima has five dimensions

- A connection: a shared notion of what constitutes a high-fidelity commitment

- Empathy: an understanding of the things that makes the 'other' distinct as a stakeholder from oneself

- Clock time: a shared sense of what constitutes time in context and the objectives or milestones that a journey of shared time (roadmap) entails

- Memory: A shared ledger, if you will, which immutably expresses what is commonly and transparently known and accepted as truth

- Shared Purpose: We gravitation around a distilled outcome becoming from many one - *E Pluribus Unum*. This is our notional capital. Whatever the legal *ownership* of capital in a very real sense it is a shared utility

  

What makes this anarchy is that anima is *sufficiently* expressed in masculinity through the absence of coercive energy -  either emotional or physical (violence) on a person. The fine line becomes nuanced in practice as incumbent participants in a polity resort to tactics required to achieve outcomes (electoral victory). Anima is essentially love without possessiveness; an abiding affection which neither wants or needs anything. Love that does not require the 'other' to requite. This removes paranoia and what is left is abstract identity (id) that contains both masculine and feminine aspects in balance - androgyny; this is the potential mate who contends because he is content to be brother. He who first works to *understand* the feminine aspect before application of his innate relentless alpha masculinity. It must both adequately express *anima* be shorn of *animus*. Large alpha is quietly zero trust without open hostility as an opening and small alpha implied as a foundation of conversation when it closes, i.e. when transparency has been both proffered and has been forthcoming. This is discussion of all (and not just us *without* them). What this means is that we are not the same (which is to say we are not identical) but we are each of *equivalent* worth or value in Creation. This notion is central to reconciliation and wholeness and demands the removal of arbitrary preference.



## But Is It Yoga? ##

The word *tattva* in Sanskrit translates to "principle," "truth," or "essence." It refers to the fundamental reality or the essential nature of something. In Indian philosophy, *tattva* is used to describe foundational principles of existence or elements of the universe. In spiritual or philosophical contexts, *tattva* denotes the true nature of reality or a principle underlying existence, aiming to reveal deeper truths about self, life, and consciousness. That true nature radiates beauty.

In the Commons, our space for discussion or conversation, *ugly* is shorthand for dissonant - asymmetry too obvious to co-exist with order and something which requires attention. It is the opposite of 'beauty' which is alignment, reason or logic that is intuitively apprehended through the five dimensions of anima. The divination of truth to discern what is *not beauty* and so requires transformation is this process. This is the essential meaning of *satyam, shivam, sundaram*. 

Generally speaking one constructs by *creating* (building or erecting), this is done through open discussion that leads to fertile ideation through language that is free of arbitrary bias (censorship). One can be said to be allowed to express Lingam (लिङ्ग, literally mark or symbol). The realized linguistics or semantic perimeter make one who they are ('am-ness'). Hence semper idem (semantic perimeter of identity embodied).

Yoga is the practice of yoking self to creation through anima so that one encompasses masculine and feminine aspects of creation in *behaviour*. In India the Sannyasin was the contemplative who are after much deliberate introspection (a self-discussion in stillness without voice) and having seen through the pantomime of the Commons and its manufactured costumed fiction would walk out of it to wander un-costumed (naked); performatively their transparent nakedness was their costume: an unspoken satyagraha that spoke truth to civilization's rigidly cast power structures that could not emanate wholeness. They saw no way to bridge the chasm between the vast fraud without and what they themselves had seen within and so they walked out. 

That's the ideal. Now civilization in its present mode is such that it encourages the opportunistic meme - merely the *veneer* of an idea and a path of least resistance to what is admittedly a version of what may be called 'the good life' *Degen rather than Scott and Helen Nearing's). Lucifer enlightens us and seeing an opportunity for indolence (efficiency) and licentiousness (procreation) - central rhetorical themes in what constitutes humanity, a melee ensues. Conferences are organized for the purpose. It is freedom untethered from responsibility and from accountability. This is the Last Man - a YOLO soft-nihilism before we settle into something more natural for the long run. Nietzsche's reset has us (and for that matter him) oscillate wildly into promiscuity before settling into a standard on what constitutes Regnum Dei. If not *entirely* wholesome it's just dessert: A date or two with a few nuts as we examine the range of what constitutes legitimacy. What could go wrong?



## Self Sufficiency ##

Shiv, the patron of yogis however is a *Sufi* - a seeker but a self-sufficient one in a metaphorical solitude as an archetype and as platonic example of what it means to retire (merely to be in one's own company as a palliative and practice. To to seek an understanding of self - and then bring it back to humanity with *Calling* as God's gift. This is a practice to be cultivated as a component of life in the midst of culture.

To walk out on a problem *entirely* is irresponsible. That is literally the meaning of the word - to reject an opportunity to take up the responsibility of exploiting an opportunity to resolve matters for our corner of Anima (or Gaia) - humanity. There are other ways to renounce an incumbent system while continuing to introspect with awareness, discover communities of people who having made a similar transition, and continue to build in civilization and the commons in ways that will allow us to align with our greater ecology.

One reason I left the practice of yoga (as it is known in the west) is precisely because I found it increasingly performative, aesthetic and even, narcissistic. It is literally full of posers - and those naively mesmerized by the pose of one leading them on. The best teachers though (my own for example) were in contrast modest, self-effacing, humble yet powerful examples of how to 'be'. Leaving them was difficult.

My own feeling is that the extravagant knots of the original sannyasin were presented as a mocking satire - a frightful mirror inspired by Kali and shown to a messy and disturbing society: the same problems were clear to the thoughtful (and cheeky yogi) thousands of years ago as they are now. This is a subtlety lost on those bending themselves painfully into some extremely weird poses unnecessarily and those assisting them into torn hamstrings. That said, I came away with some clever ideas as I shifted to urban and wilderness protocols and methods - strategic and tactical. These tune awareness in the world much as introspection does in the quiet warm moments before dawn where I cultivated a seated vipassana practice - I needed to slow down.



## Guy Forks ##

All of this as an alternative political-economy began to evolve in the world;  A platform where I might apply my professional *and* intellectual ambitions. I fancied myself paradoxically as simultaneously the sharp point of an arrow as well as the mark it was aimed for coming full circle to understand to fully understand my objectives for the first time. 



 











The process of coming to awareness requires us to interpret creation's flow (*Dhara), 'hold a lamp' (*Diya*) to it in order clarify or filter truth, and then actualize meaningful change deliberately with vision (*Drishti*). 

This is the idea of 'masculine' and 'feminine' energy in yoga; the Sun and Moon respectively heating and cooling together maintain the Planet in equilibrium as it travels.  Yoga extends the idea of holistic regulation in the associated philosophy of Ayurveda. Where one of three constitutions; Vata (Ether and Air) is responsible for movement, circulation, respiration, and nerve function. The other two are Pitta (Fire and Water) and Kapha (Earth and Water). The manifestation of balance in nature requires all three to be in equilibrium with Vata automating governance, heating and cooling, our behaviour to actuate a sustainable balance. Vata's Ether aspect amounts to the 'spaces within us and the ones we create between us' - the ones we were so concerned about during the lockdown. Humanity draws from Air, Fire and Earth, combining it with Ether to generate [*flow* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) *to* create productively since the beginning. Holistically, in modern civilization, humanity needs a mechanism to regulate currency - that which flow between us - to manage scarce resources sustainably and assure perpetual abundance - [s*ine qua non*](https://transition-insight.com/?blogcategory=Sine+Qua+Non+(Humanity+%26+AI))  - without which, (there is) nothing for humans who wish to 'be' over the long run. 

My daughters names are Dhara, Diya and Drishti. I'm guiding Drishti, my youngest, a budding 16 year-old coder, to communities that explore technologies that riff on these existential notions to create a more holistic utility for our information technology, mostly through dinner conversations on political-economy. We assiduously avoid retail politics. I have my own views on the 2024 US Election and while my daughters' opinions are starkly different, I not only tolerate and understand them but having raised them, seeing the world from their vantage and being staked in their future - as women - I can embrace them. We have different 'energies', outlooks and perspectives.

## Into The Ether of Mind ##

*Gaia (or Anima)* is a myth *larger* than life - relevant even before life existed *for us*. We have myths to model *complex* social systems in context the way we model chemistry, physics and biology with those cute physical models in class. Vata is breath and Ether our interstitial aspect of inhalation/exhalation and expansion/contraction; one that needs credible and neutral expression in our technological architecture so that we may set an objective price to what we collectively need to value (including how time and notional capital is applied).

**The Dao of Capital**

*Now you're at the wheel Tell me how, how does it feel? So good to have equalized To lift up the lids of your eyes* 

*~* The Stone Roses (Waterfall)

As a counterpoint to stillness there is motion and in creation it expresses a stillness that flows (*being* without toil). Just as yoga directs us to be inaction in action, so to the Dao's invocation is to be *in* vocation. The *Dao De Ching* counsels us to be like the water as it falls to it destination. For those of you in technology think of those waterfall projects. Remember how we used traceability in setting out a 'token' of value for the customer- a functional or non-functional requirement? Then carry it through the BRD (Business Requirements Document), SRS (System Requirements Specifications), the TDD (Technical Design Document) and TRD (Technical Requirements Document) yoking the documentation of those customer needs and wants through the length our software delivery lifecycle? Remember the pain when 'Business' couldn't precisely define which user journeys added most value or how? Our subjective guessing game continued as we finalized those requirements caused us to constantly update those documents - changing line items in the in-scope section of mandatory and nice to have functionality and caught up with the impossible question of trying to forecast how much value we could deliver in the calendar year? It wasn't really so much waterfall as a constant churn that went nowhere. 

Now imagine [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/#what-are-daos) (distributed autonomous organizations) premised on a set of universally applicable values express through a protocol, defining objectively with data and analytics where value can be derived for our customers (the community that matters - our tribe). Capital is staked to the products and teams deliver that value - now the team is incentivized to deliver with care and quality - reduce the time and effort to deliver change by emphasizing quality. Imagine acceptance criteria objectively defined in a smart contract that 'defines done' as pre-requisite for passage through the CI/CD pipeline, with the team focused all the while focused on one priority (top of the backlog) delivered with quality before moving to the next. This again is the idea of Yoga (yoking) our work to the needs of our customers, aligned with the market as a whole - serving one without compromising the security of the whole.

Over time, the Turing-completeness of our AI will evolve to the extent that it incrementally better understands, through us and our products; ones that serve customers and evolve to meet their needs without compromising the those of the commons. The key to human-centric AI that dovetails private and public interests is having objective data interpreted by *public* blockchain networks in a relatively decentralized manner (to mitigate bias while making justifiable architectural trade-offs). All the while, costs are borne entirely by those who use the network and not in any sense externalized - that means proof of stake.

To understand the digital tokens secure nodes that verify and validate transactions on proof of stake networks better, ironically, a good starting point is our prehistoric past. Something we explore in the [Part ](https://transition-insight.com/f/the-promise-of-blockchain-and-ai-the-prehistoric-ledger)4 where I riff on the late anthropologist and anarchist David Graeber's take on our prehistoric past. Digital tokens are obviously not material in the physical sense - and we don't need our token to be a tangibly scarce commodity - those including gold are in any case too industrially valuable in a productive sense to use as tokens or hoard as a 'standard'. Similarly, prehistoric communities transacted value without material tokens.
