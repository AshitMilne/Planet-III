# Sine Qua Non 2: Machina


## Introduction
In this third installment of *Sine Qua Non*, we introduce the metaphors **Machina** and **Anima** to consider the intelligence inherent in the architecture of reality. The earth operated as an autonomous perpetual machine before humanity emerged. Intelligence was in **habit** (i.e., dwelling within a persistent but evolving architecture—a global-macro *semper idem*). There was no extrinsic rule or algorithm sought to enhance operation within it.


## The Planet Works
Evolution appears to be a process pushing intelligence out of the inert matter we began the planet with. The system as a whole was adaptive to its environment and incrementing slowly while manifesting intelligent life. Periodically, systemic resets of life came through the “fire and brimstone” of Earth's shifting thermal behavior—setting the world alight with flame or awash with salt. Alternatively, it was the impact of inanimate extraterrestrial bodies (meteors). Each of these catalysts for shifting life in a radical and novel direction adjusted to the new circumstances, as intelligence pivoted to a new strategy. The latest of these is to put an animal capable of both objective precision and playful mirth on the board. One that apprehended cycles, calling them *saeculum*, and in time, as civilization grew in size, they also came to think too of apocalypse (invariably a rout of humanity brought on by its accumulated fissures).

Humanity is the jolly ape imbued with imagination and delight at finding itself at the wheel of heavy machinery: a technology it has yet to wield adeptly. We're still just excited about being exceptionally 'brainy' and we're showing that off with some pretty wild stunt driving; it's not our habit to ask for directions or read the instructions. In any case, it's our driving that makes the road. Every tiny decision that each of us makes sends us collectively to one destination or another on a jagged, volatile path. We can't make Eden better. Only ourselves, but our inability to face the truth of the Anthropocene is a penchant for compromising truth to continue an assault on its beauty. I have had the best life imaginable and I am perfectly fine with either destination—as you like it. I travel with you, and the journey is better for it.

Earth's default technology stack worked well. It is algorithmically objective and net neutral. There is no debasement. The earth's system design does not generate extraneous heat. There's no constant grinding toil and therefore no endless conversation concerning 'inflation' or 'whether it could even be forecasted in the current climate.' Lacking what you and I would call bias, the remainder of our planet's inhabitants do not need to deliberate towards demonstrable consensus—a preference for or against the extinction of life. They are too much in the midst of being to be vexed by hypotheticals.

Subsequently, there was no extravagant consumption, nor a forgetfulness of being that would evolve into a discussion, and thence a *mudra* required to understand what constituted **Yoga**—an alignment to the commons and creation: an understanding of what was lost and now had to be found in order for one to coexist without the other. This was an equivalence that didn't equivocate nor need to debate questions, interpretations, definitions, or distinctions of terminology interminably about equality and equity.

Humanity’s emergence into this system was itself dictated by changes in climate. The collision of the sub-continent into the Eurasian landmass, stemming the flow of airborne moisture into Africa, forced us out of our treetop perches as dense forest receded. The Sun's shock of new heat too forced us into a more practical upright stance as we made our way. However, it was a very long time after that—tens of millions of years—before we began to organize ourselves into tribes that grew ever larger and disparate. When they did appear, however, they evolved into hierarchical structures that afforded degrees of opulence or luxury to a few. This might have been seen as functional, where a tribe's prestige is expressed as the way in which its leadership is presented to the world.

With our numbers still small, these weren't destructive in a wholesale way. However, in modernity, as we look upon those ancient expressions of power still projected at what styles itself as the democratic world's leadership—the planes, helicopters, official residences, the entourage of advisors, secretaries, speechwriters, and the motorcades they travel in—you ask whether you and your ecology are getting your money's worth. Hopefully, as citizen and taxpayer embedded in the incumbent structure or system, you feel at least that this is a framework you are willing to participate in. Some of us, however, have in different ways forked to set for us all a secure framework with a lower price tag across the board—as consumer, citizen, or just an ape (bored or otherwise) in an ever more depleted ecology.




## Humanity Stakes
In Dial Square, my model for layers of the identity stack, the **Stone Rose** was the totality of the planet's material—inert and alive—while **Hour Glass of Redcurrant** was evolution itself, the environment, or the surface tension between matter and energy where things were made to happen and adapt. Humanity uniquely has the capacity to introspect. To wonder about the nature of reality and to ask why it is that we come to exist and what our purpose is. We model that reality in terms of symbols that resonate in the myths, metaphors, and analogies that our tribe collects on its journey. This, after first carving out for ourselves a modicum of comfort first. That comfort derived is cause of elation and joy in our collection of tribes; each small discovery, foothold or firm purchase made to persist our collective, is a goal-mouth celebration in nature's face in the face of adversity and the constant tragedy of loss. It is natural for us then to model our relationship to the world as an adversarial one and one where we have a right to claim from it what we need to make our life; other groups or collectives can become a part of that scenery, appearing as 'other' with their own peculiar models and symbols. If not entirely strange in their manners, themes, and color schemes, they are at least 'strangers'. In each of our collectives, as we seek to persist and remove the madness from our method, we look amongst ourselves for the exemplary, and aping them, we developed instead a pride about our manner. This becomes the essence of who we are; a distillation of the tribe's spirit becomes the manners of the tribe—our ways writ symbolically in word and in deed ritually become who we are, virtually and literally. Affinity is beyond proximation. This distillation of spirit—**Hourglass of Redcurrant (HGR or hugger)**—holds us close to our folk. The idea of HGR expresses the universality of this principle so that we may look beyond a scarcity that no longer needs to be modeled in our reality and no longer draw fine points around symbols that are increasingly difficult to reconcile with pluralism, particularly in the west.

In this complex world, moving towards seven billion individuals who insist on becoming who they aspire to be—something more than an accident of birth—a common HGR serves as a denominator defining a consensus of what constitutes legitimate self-sovereign behavior. Meanwhile, each transaction—a purchase or a conversation, a coming together of any kind, in fact—is numerated against this. In a world that, while providing abundantly for us, is obviously finite, it is prioritized in a way that serves our tribe (however it's defined by HGR) while being constructive as we engage with the world beyond that 'community'—the rest of creation that you and yours are a part of. Dance is, perhaps, as close as we get to a state of letting oneself go to become one with a moment. The movement expressed is its own proof of work, and the pleasure we feel is for our own sake and for those that gravitate to dance with us—staking with us in a moment of recognition as something worth being a part. HGR requires that we acknowledge too the ways of others by accepting their presence, preferably at some distance, respectful of their ways which we must accept as not our own.

## Claiming Legitimacy

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution
~ 4 Non-Blondes (What's Up?)

A dense object's gravitational pull is not legitimacy: Jove's grandeur is symbolic—i.e., a matter of comparative opinion until it is turned from planet to God. Gravity, like arithmetic, has certain rules, and you cannot make your own maths. Logic does not require brute-force; the maths aren't particularly hard and do not require the wisdom of large numbers. Our Sun, in relative terms, is stationary while its array of satellites dance in perfect equilibrium as though round a maypole. This is the model that entails legitimacy and indeed the reason a collective so dances.

So, legitimacy is recognized into existence, not coerced into hegemony through force majeure. We gravitate around and are not pulled remorselessly into the legitimate. As with a flywheel, the monotonous, rapid spin that power manifests as in incumbent systems repels us. They no longer draw cleanly to tell us a compelling narrative of heroes coming full circle. *Jackanory* becomes 'Jack ignore He'. The dense structures of its agencies and network turn out to be an artifice constructed of costume and ceremony without creative power. The incumbent Patriarchy's institutions are too far gone for him to sit comfortably; regime change is incumbent on those enterprising and creative free radicals with vision steeped in a systemic understanding born of experience.

Once you recognize abundance and surrender your own personal narratives of scarcity—ones that tied you to the incumbent institutions—you are in a position to actualize legitimate behavior into being in the insurgency, the structure being architected to hold our collective spirit.

## Unanimity Inspired

**Anima** is the term used to describe the intelligence that emanated into the world before humanity. Deriving from it is the term **unanimity**—unity animated in amity—which is the compiled code encapsulated in profound consensus. It serves as the standard for which proves stake through behavior—one that is, by default, infused with empathy: A form of work which flows continuously without the toil and accelerating spin of the mesmerizing compromise for sound narrative we know today.
