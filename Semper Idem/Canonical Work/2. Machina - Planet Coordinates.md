# Sine Qua Non 3: Machina

![Machina](C:\Users\Ash\Documents\Planet III\Semper Idem\Vault\Images\Machina.jfif)

**Introduction** This third installment of Sine Qua Non and the one that follows it runs a thread from a primordial past to from the biblically mythologized Genesis 'in the beginning' through the Genesis of (utterly) decentralized protocols coordinating objective value discussed in part two to that coordination that would have automaticity in *human-centric* system design (proof of stake) where values - a form of bias grounded in empathy or concern is applied to the raw objective algorhthym that is both nature and machinery's wont.

## The Planet Work

And I try
Oh my God, do I try
I try all the time
In this institution
And I pray
Oh my God, do I pray
I pray every single day
For revolution  
~ 4 Non-Blondes ([What's Up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZb1xalWidQ))

The Planet without humanity was an idyllic Eden. It was without a desire for agency, namely the intelligence to imagine and manufacturer or affect an alternative version of what persists at current in reality and then affect a change in it. Comfort had automaticity for its live occupants for they were tuned into creation's frequency adapting to circumstances (call it weather or climate - whichever you prefer) in real time. In the technology stack it was the hardware and network and its work was algorithmically objective. There was no debasement. The earth's system design did not generate extraneous heat. There was no toil and therefore no conversation concerning 'inflation' or 'whether it could even be forecasted in the current climate'.  Lacking what you and I would call bias - the inhabitants of earth, all creatures great and small cannot even be said to have expressed a practical and apparent consensus - a preference for or against the extinction of life on the planet in word, or more to the point. 

In Dial Square, my model of metaphors for the layers of identity that stack to animate intelligence and become an ever constant but evolving *semper idem*, a torch-bearer of heritage who leaves a trail in word and deed of behaviour manifested in the world. Neither nectar nor sap was processed to create [H]our glass of Redcurrant. Subsequently there was no extravagant consumption, nor a forgetfulness of being that would evolve into a discussion, and thence a mudra required to understand what constituted Yoga - an alignment to the commons and creation: an understanding of what was lost and now had to be found in order for one to to coexist without duel or dual - equivalence that didn't equivocate nor need to debate questions, interpretations, definitions or distinctions of terminology interminably about equality and equity.

In the tens of millennia since, we have created the institutions that the 4 Non-Blondes sing about: The Commons. As well we pray for some rapid transformation - a revolution - feeling an alienation from them and we even imagine and escape into the deep sensate connectedness that the Wachowskis beautifully created in Sense8 in which the song played out as protagonists collective found themselves in each other. Yet here we are able to express and create freely and unhindered in these institutions narratives that seeks to transform them. Therein lies the conflict and the need for reconciliation - at least one felt by this brown favourite son of (white) western civilization. Energy may be the basis for money, but without humanity creation cannot have been said to be unintelligible or unintelligent. Nor inchoate and coherent. There was *work*. Critters built warrens, and nests, foraged and even coordinated to trail and trap quarry. Over time they 'we' (as in life on earth - our ancestors before we evolved to be human) developed technique (know-how and wherewithal) that was *a kind of* heritage - an intellectual capital without *property* and without notional tokens or favours traded in kind dictating terms on which we collectively distilled intelligence to be transacted. This was passed on by each generation. We ourselves apparently did the same thing until we developed written language. In Indo-Aryan languages rīt (रीत) means way or customs. In English we have the word ritual derived from the same root etymology. These ritual were protocols. Processes by which we came to the correct (intended) outcome. *Intention* was all and it was the shorthand that would be allow hierarchies to produce and present a writ - the written dictates of governance as what we imagined as leadership became to be realized. Our unwritten expectation was that our betters knew better and that protocols were shorthanded into writ as a labour saving 'modern convenience' for society's adherence. This evolved of course, in to law in western common and civil traditions - legislation that implied benefit rather than expressed it in objective auditable code.



**START AGAIN HERE - KEEP GROUNDED- WATCH..YOU'RE GETTING A BIT POETIC - COME DOWN**





## While Humanity Staked ## 

In a complex world moving towards seven billion nations or none depending on your perspective we chafe at arbitrary constraints imposed by the institutions of power*.* Its manifest unfairness made all the more apparent as those with power and privilege (though increasingly scarce prestige) routinely fly across 'red lines' with casual insouciance. 

The deliberate reference to brotherhood in the song speaks to entrenched bias that has *always* intermediated our relationships to one another with the aim of maintaining order; one that rests on strength and ultimately the Sovereign's monopoly on violence; and then reaches through layers of hierarchical delegation and proxy to manage an understandably restless and increasingly uncivil society.

This contrasts starkly with creation beyond humanity; [*Anima*](https://transition-insight.com/f/3-gaia---earth-as-life?blogcategory=Sine+Qua+Non+(Intelligence)) as it is today was once Machina and whole. It remains aligned to the Universe but as our 'take' increases with any 'give' it begins to animate instinctively to rise against us - becoming ever more volatile in response to our violence upon it. It is *being* and in constant [*flow*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) -  the result, a stream of 'virtual consciousness' operating directly without intermediary. To the extent that intermediaries are delegated so that the particular may scale, designation of herd alphas say, the delegate is immediately and transparently accountable to the herd on pain of death. Through nature, whether sentient or otherwise, life's decision-making adapts over time (machine learns); Anima is networked and *ordinates* in real time to meet immediate wants *or* needs **at scale** - and without humanity to interfere (e.g. domestication) there is evident wholeness. There hasn't been that kind of accountability in human society for a very long time primarily because we are unable to artfully mind the gaps between us; rational behaviour between potential competitors or collaborators requires a degree of transparency and there are already biases that tilt us away from objective material self-interest - the loss aversion that keeps us from working together even within organizations that lack a culture of transparency. These would for example prevent status driven participants from cooperating with someone who's status rises *relative* to them (manifesting from insecurity really). As well, most people are moving way too fast in a state of frenzied panic - modern life throws demands and we are all too readily add to those with commitments - homes, cars and vacations - as expressions of status more than real joy - sometimes just to throw shade at the bemused who have far less of any kind of *real* baggage. The pace and spiralling commitments lead to ever greater compromises - mistakes are made and now you're *really* afraid of people knowing the truth (but they already do - you're playing with yourself - without much skill.

Mired in an opaque system with identities obscured and trust hard to infer we exploit our collective fallen selves to manifest a semi-charmed life of slavery to a third eye blind Goliath ([Azazel](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Azazel)) who mesmerize us. As Common People, we don't defect, we 'quietly quit' our clock punching bullshit jobs through our work week longing for a weekend of catharsis; *we dance, drink and screw, because there’s nothing else to do* - the numbness of a drug  - there she goes, there she goes again - to drain the pressure from swollen ennui until Monday when we return to the unfolding dirty-bomb [Guernica](https://www.google.com/search?gs_ssp=eJzj4tFP1zcsNjAtqkzOyDFg9BJJL00tystMTlQoLsnPS1Uoyi9OLQYA2HIMeQ&q=guernica+stone+roses&rlz=1C1CHBF_enCA1106CA1106&oq=guernica+stone+rose&gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgBEC4YgAQyCggAEAAY4wIYgAQyBwgBEC4YgAQyBggCEEUYOTINCAMQABiGAxiABBiKBTINCAQQABiGAxiABBiKBTIKCAUQABiABBiiBDIKCAYQABiABBiiBDIKCAcQABiABBiiBNIBCDQ4MjJqMGo3qAIAsAIA&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8#wptab=si:ACC90nzcg09uT9dLCxMVYtMO0-0pjgQ_JR12fuxEIIyv63Ip94qTV1AYapsQRC_0ZtNEAZpU3-3dREySloLM-0inWxxcRaJlCMaoOK5ddl-rj9pIinndNLEr8XRx_L8NiyHunR9QoHJiwUxDe-0EswH58IsVm3agnkCDzVXlg99Z8QTD5Robnto%3D). 

There's an underlying tenet beneath such behaviour that aligns interests - of the individual to those of the layered collectives right through to the planet itself; trust that stems from common values of equity, fairness, openness and above all, the transparency that makes it clear that those qualities are in abundance here. The Latin *Ars Perfectum Jugum* implies a yoked transparent expression of self-evident quality, equilibrium and integral strength. I didn't pose nude on LinkedIn just for fun - I was making a point that comes easily to those who know what do be proud of and what to be ashamed of. Symbolic action that expresses contempt for arbitrary gossip and judgement are important and can be made in any number of ways - appalling in private to make abundantly clear transgressive assault; as well as the sublime out in the open 'hold my queer'. The beautiful result is ego death which clears the path to rational, kind and objectively positive sum behaviour that traces right through the *machina*. Proof of Stake as a decentralized transactional protocol is an algorithmic expression of these values which can even be extended into more dynamic frameworks with Latin values. That is not what we have today where centralized nodes of Sovereigns (accountable only to themselves in the case of the hegemon) and corporates (albeit relatively sound ones - but still obviously revenue motivated and not necessarily comprehensively objectively transparent. 

**Computer Says No**

*I am a one in ten, a number on a list I am a one in ten, even though i don't exist Nobody knows me, but I'm always there A statistic, a reminder of a world that doesn't care* 

~ UB40 ([One in Ten](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCGcljqOSW0))

Some time in 2001 a group of us (mixed client and IBM consultants) gathered at an 8th corner table of a Piano-shaped building in Toronto. It had pretty view of the busy thoroughfare on Front Street - a pleasant backdrop for a conversation on development requirements. Apropos nothing at all a client employee raised my company's complicity with Nazi Germany's 'Final Solution'. I'm not sure how he managed to dovetail that gem into our conversation but it was a mischievous piece of edgy banter and I was well impressed but had no clever response - I stared blankly.

The comment came with a raised eyebrow and wry smile - the cheeky look of expectancy - one I failed to live up to. I'm not sure what prompted it. Perhaps my Indo-Aryan name and heritage combined with German scholarship's obsession with India and Vedic culture in general? I'm almost certainly overthinking it. I suppose I was just IBM to him - the epitome of the relentlessly exploitative corporation - but one I loved being a part of.

I am conscious of the company's culpability and complicity into the 20th century's greatest crime - the holocaust. It isn't just the inordinate arithmetic - but the *sheer* quality of the frugal and value-driven culture of intelligence and humility of the lives being destroyed that galls - we can ill afford to lose them. I feel our species depends on sustaining and growing. I try to see the good in everyone but all too often I see the indifferent. There's no conspiracy perhaps but I feel a quiet consent was given across *states* that are not true nations - financial city states that compute in plain arithmetic number go up means we get a 'result' (the bigger the result the better). 'It's not our problem and there's nothing we can do - *someone* should do something and I'm not sure what exactly, but we might as well make quarterly revenue - someone else will otherwise. Hopefully someone comes along to quietly work on it while we generate revenue.

In the aftermath of the war as the true extent of the horror was made clear, American benevolence was felt - the Marshall Plan ensure that the unfairness of Versailles wasn't repeated. It's corporate behemoth IBM too made amends in 1955 with a small but significant linguistic contribution   opposition to Anglo-Saxon penchant for adding. Instead of 'Computer' they chose 'ordinateur' - a term ready made by the pioneer of AI with considerable insight. It implies a capacity to assess systematically whole positive-sum results that work for all.

*Am I a god, or am I Jesus? Am I a man, or am I a boy?* 

*Do I feel love, or just possession? Do I feel holy, or nothing at all?*

*You can't deny that your shit just tastes as sweet as mine And you can't deny that your shit just tastes as sweet as mine, sweet Jesus*

For those of you not familiar with Chad (pictured below), he's a staple of crypto meme culture and believes we can do better than brute strength math. His answer is '[Yes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yBJwg2-wX0w)'. For starters AI does prospectively fit into a humanistic solution - already - and not just in the future. As we build applications online that serve our stakeholders (customers, citizens, clients, community) we already have the ability to rationalize and parse the mass of data through CRM and data analytics tools on user experience and preferences (i.e. their wants and needs) to identify and *rationally* prioritize opportunities to satisfy their requirements.

*"AI will probably most likely lead to the end of the world, but in the meantime there'll be great companies" - Sam Altman, OpenAI CEO*

![img](//img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/674c7aa6-fcc2-4283-a438-de467701f51c/YesChad.png/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280)Edit Image

Sam's right, there are great companies - Apple, Google and Microsoft. Giants who themselves stood on the shoulders of other great companies whose time has come and gone. They're built by visionaries, sometimes so idealist as to even start their firms with 'Do No Evil' (as was the case with Google). 

As these companies evolve their operating strategy and embrace architectures for the simple reason that they are more secure and economical ([Hedera](https://hedera.com/) a notable example), we move towards models that are distributive and lean into identity abstraction; information security governance at large global enterprises is no longer able to scale existing [PIM](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/id-governance/privileged-identity-management/pim-configure)  - privileged (identity) access management approaches; firms are just too global in scale and profiling 100,000s employees for susceptibility to susceptibility to compromise is no longer viable. With a zero trust posture the implication, for example, is that Satya Nadella or Sundar Pichai are each *personally* responsible for a potentially material threat to their firms. You can bet 'Truth' and 'Beauty' are looking for improved utility. Alternative architectures are being evolved - both Google and Microsoft are certainly in pursuit of them and these will be available to smaller enterprises - the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 for example and those beyond them.

**Dancin' down on Life with Agility**

*Greedy little people in a sea of distress Keep your more to receive your less Unimpressed by material excess Love is free, love me say hell yes*

*...*

*Lucky me, swimmin' in my ability Dancin' down on life with agility Come and drink it up, from my fertility Blessed with a bucket of lucky mobility*

~ Red Hot Chili Peppers ([Give It Away Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mr_uHJPUlO8&pp=ygURcmhjcCBnaXZlIGl0IGF3YXk%3D))

At the same time, while we wait for identity abstraction to bring us closer to our customers, clients, citizens so that we may serve them better - social graphing to draw us to our tribes (modern western versions of credibly neutral keiretsu/chaebol and the individual customers who adore brands) those of us in SDLC governance have for a long time - practically my entire career thought about how we manage risk - capital and time in particular. This isn't as much an issue at web-native firms and certainly not in crypto; one summer weekend in 2023 I snuck into a Ethereum Hackathon at [EthGlobal ](https://ethglobal.com/)Waterloo, down the road from where I live, as a volunteer to get a sense of things while setting up tables, chairs and stuffing loot bags. I was even the 'muscle' at the door on day one checking credentials and exchanging a smiled greeting with [Vitalik](https://vitalik.eth.limo/) as I let him pass (since he was dressed for work in a way that was comfortable for him and I saw nothing to object to on that score); I watched as he patiently chatted with a sudden throng of excited accolades. I also chatted with the teams arriving from around the world on their projects as they lined up to present them to the judges guiding them to tables as they became available. The 'vibe' is exudes brilliance and enthusiasm (proverbial rainbows and unicorns) - even the jaded veteran comes away with a sense of optimism (and not just from working with the eponymous Layer 2 [protocol ](https://www.optimism.io/)- I chatted with a founder, a Canadian from Ipswich while he was being badged for entry**). Next time around, I'll invite the whole bunch to stay on my two acres and hack here or at least sleep on my couches. Teams work autonomously geared entirely to a specific problems in the marketplace without having to contend with architecture (social or technical) that comprises this commitment with 'organizational' imperative.

I've contended with a lack of empowerment and transparency at the traditional so-called 'enterprise' my entire career and the challenge of at one and the same time meeting our customers' expectations for quality (including resilience, redundancy, stability etc.) against 'leadership's' expectations on schedule and beyond that the focus on the return to shareholders near term. Often hierarchy is not amenable to plain truth and the messenger is shot (or rather shown the door). Not to say that this something that the *typical* project manager thinks about such weighty matters, but it has concerned me because of my background in global political economy, the social sciences generally, financial markets, and to the degree necessary, technological architecture. My outlook is unapologetically strategic even when ensconced in 'execution'; I balk at firms who bar their employees from using AI because they cannot trust them to apply basic common sense or let arbitrary political considerations prevent basic dialogue on governance among key stakeholders. Fundamentally I have basic concerns about the lack of transparency in the modern corporation at the level of social architecture and that impacts the applications they build (per [Conway's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_law)). They will fail. Perhaps not today or tomorrow, but ultimately they will fail to serve their customers and by extension the broader commons (ultimately *everyone* is a stakeholder) unless they pivot.

Agility involves getting getting close to the customer, knowing what's most important to them and delivering it with focused efficiency and sustainability. Engaged people are obsessed with our customers needs and wants; they build relationships with them, viscerally understanding them by regularly *listening* *to* and *watching them;* they challenge inherent corporate bias or the impulse of arbitrary hierarchical intervention and they are empowered to act without permission or censorship *autonomously*; they build long-term rapport and trust by committing their team to delivering user journeys that address discrete problems. Leaders are essentially the human analogues of secure nodes that validate and verify on the distributed and decentralized network.

**Waterfall**

*Now you're at the wheel Tell me how, how does it feel? So good to have equalized To lift up the lids of your eyes* 

*~* The Stone Roses (Waterfall)

For those of you in technology think of those waterfall projects. Remember how we used traceability in setting out a 'token' of value for the customer- a functional or non-functional requirement? Then carry it through the BRD (Business Requirements Document), SRS (System Requirements Specifications), the TDD (Technical Design Document) and TRD (Technical Requirements Document) yoking the documentation of those customer needs and wants through the length our software delivery lifecycle? Remember the pain when 'Business' couldn't precisely define which user journeys added most value or how? Our subjective guessing game as we finalized those requirements caused us to constantly update those documents - changing line items in the in-scope section of mandatory and nice to have functionality and caught up with the impossible question of trying to forecast how much value we could deliver in the calendar year? Now imagine defining objectively with data and analytics where value can be derived for our customers and then staking capital (say enterprise tokens) to the products and teams deliver that value - now the team is incentivized to deliver with care and quality - reduce the time and effort to deliver change by emphasizing quality. Imagine acceptance criteria objectively defined in a smart contract that 'defines done' as pre-requisite for passage through the CI/CD pipeline, with the team focused all the while focused on one priority (top of the backlog) delivered with quality before moving to the next. This again is the idea of Yoga (yoking) our work to the needs of our customers, aligned with the market as a whole - serving one without compromising the other. *So good to have equalized, lift out the lids of our eyes and see with vision.*

Over time, the Turing-completeness of our AI will evolve to the extent that it incrementally better understands, through us and our products; ones that serve customers and evolve to meet their needs without compromising the those of the commons. The key to human-centric AI that dovetails private and public interests is having objective data interpreted by *public* blockchain networks in a relatively decentralized manner (to mitigate bias while making justifiable architectural trade-offs). All the while, costs are borne entirely by those who use the network and not in any sense externalized - that means proof of stake.

To understand the digital tokens secure nodes that verify and validate transactions on proof of stake networks better, ironically, a good starting point is our prehistoric past. Something we explore in the [Part 3](https://transition-insight.com/f/the-promise-of-blockchain-and-ai-the-prehistoric-ledger) where I riff on the late anthropologist and anarchist David Graeber's take on our prehistoric past. Digital tokens are obviously not material in the physical sense - and we don't need our token to be a tangibly scarce commodity - those including gold are in any case too industrially valuable in a productive sense to use as tokens or hoard as a 'standard'. Similarly, prehistoric communities transacted value without material tokens.
