Above: Hiroshima - if it's not love, then it's the bomb that will bring us together. Now that's fusion (even though it's fission).

Death is a release from the impressions of sense, and from the impulses that make us their puppets from the vagaries of the mind, and the hard service of the flesh. It is a disgrace for the soul to be the first to succumb in that life in which the body does not succumb.

~ Marcus Aurelius, Book VI - 28, 29

**Introduction: We Play For MacArthur's Erection**

Note: This is not meant as a diatribe and I should hope that my affection and appreciation for American heritage, particularly its transcendentalist vein is obvious. I'd go so far as to say that I'm the average American's notion of what would be ideal in leadership - with an ability to critically analyse data with intuitive reason without bias - or at least having the willingness to submit to consensus. And I'm the closest thing there is to the ideal American (in the transcendental anarchist and indigenous mode of that country's early heritage) that isn't actually an American - which affords me a vantage that Americans cannot be expected to possess. We are a part of a broader Anglo-Saxon heritage that the rest of the world has no alternative but to look to for leadership (offered hopefully by stepping off throats rather than on them). Please accept this commentary on nihilism in that spirit. Then look at the conduct of our own five-eye leaders and ask whether they pass muster. My intention here is to examine nihilism through the lens of personal experience, modeling it as a chasm divined between truth (Satya) and beauty (Sundar) and to make a fine point without a nom de guerre nor even a plume de guerre.

Our language is being devolved for us. Nihilism is now often defined as denigrating or criticizing, or even calling for the reconstruction of 'sacrosanct' institutions (on-chain where possible because code is law and we know which rules work for the self-aware). I demur. For me, nihilism is the still fury of a Mitsubishi Zero making an statement with impact on the platform of an aircraft carrier; for these finely built aircraft of *divine* wind the precision arithmetic was 'less than Zero': "Bound to be a better ride than what youâ€™ve got planned, carry your cup in your hand and look around you." A somewhat disproportionately casual but dark and bigly response was to use the most common thing in the universe (hydrogen) as a 'pay' load to still the lifeblood of a nation. The first was for dough and the second for show as they say. Do I have it backwards or did they?

Now, one [*poet's*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima) measured response was to turn upon himself after the slow-drip death march of his nation to make the finest of points; turning himself into a gutless wonder *literally*. Somehow, to me at least, he doesn't seem such a nihilist after all; he even comes off (a well-hard) pacifist.

**A View To A Kill**

A sacred why, a mystery gaping inside A week is why, until we... Dance into the fire That fatal kiss is all we need Dance into the fire To fatal sounds of broken dreams Dance into the fire That fatal kiss is all we need Dance into the fire 

~ Duran Duran (View To A Kill)

I didn't travel much in Japan - just up and down Wakayama to hang with my JET colleagues or to nearby Koya-San, Kyoto and Osaka or Tokyo (for work). In those days before widespread cellular or internet (1991-1993) you were truly immersed in a country when you lived in its rural hinterland. My escapism came on shortwave (the BBC World Service), The Guardian Weekly and The Economist, the books past around, taped VHS episodes of Kids in The Hall, SNL, Seinfeld or Black Adder. Of course there was Tower Records in Osaka where I spent a bundle (surprise) and the video rentals were (thankfully) filled to the brim 'our' culture. Much as I adored the country in those days I looked to reconnect my base; to recharge my sense of self amidst the awkward mix of unintended alienation and warm welcome that only Japan offers a foreigner. I loved my work - it involved rotating through Wakayama City's eighteen junior high schools coaching student on language and culture, working with teachers on lesson plans and generally giving these young people an idea of what a young modern presumably 'model' native speaker was; my colleagues were exemplary - from the United States, Britain, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. I mean, we partied and got a bit nuts on the weekend but we were diligent and enthusiastic in our work come Monday. We wanted to *represent* and were proud to have be given the chance to do so - and we all fell in love with Japan. Whenever we left the country, returning felt like 'coming home'. The kids at our schools loved us back. The excitement was palpable standing in front of them - big grins and wide-eyes - as though we were rock stars - they'd ask for pictures and autographs. And it was astonishing how those kids changes as they geared through the grades - and as well how much the culture in one school was so different from another. Culture can be so local in the sense of 'mood'. Whatever the context, has a particular fragrance or shade relative in its appeal to an individual's sense of taste. Every conversation is a transaction that sets a qualitative value that accumulates to make create a vibe for a place and a time. In some places I'd arrive and the mood was was heavy or oppressive (exams coming perhaps?); at other times buoyant - and perhaps it all down to one or two who beat the trail for others to walk.

When a good long break like Christmas rolled along I was off to somewhere 'English' for while; the echo of England that Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand etc. still emanated - Raffles, cricket and good curry (and lashings of it) for example - or just to sit at a cafe reading a English-language daily over beer - and watch the world pass by in some place that was 'international' and full of 'bright young things'; Jesus, that's I jonesed for. I was twenty-two teaching English in the public school system during the two year spell between my degrees at Western and Carleton. It feels a lifetime ago now. Japan would draw me again twice - an exchange student at the International University of Japan ([IUJ](https://www.iuj.ac.jp/)) and then later as Monbusho Scholar at [Hitotsubashi ](https://www.hit-u.ac.jp/eng/)in Tokyo.

**Trainstopping**

One morning, I don't recall whether it was a holiday or just the weekend but I got it in my head to head to the Wakayama Station check schedule and then jump on a series of trains to visit Hiroshima. I spent the day circling the monument (above) taking photographs and slowly meandering through the museum quietly alone before catching the train home in the light of late evening. I don't think I spoke a single word that day. It's just as well - what could one possibly have to say? The city's name reverberates for any student of political science or history and so it was for me - I had no idea what else was on offer in terms of 'attractions' but we all know why the name rings in our collective conscience - the death of some 140,000 civilians with a single piece of ordinance - one shell. Let that sink in.  America's got talent (or at least had it) - that bomb represents the very 'height' of 20th century America's productivity and industrial ingenuity in the service of war. I likes ineffectual wars even unreal ones; the War on Cancer and the War on Drugs are two particularly pointless ones that somehow kill tens of thousands (or rather not save them) without the use of any ordinances whatsoever. The bomb was dropped in the name of western civilization (my own corner of it included) and detonated above what was once the Hiroshima Prefectural Industrial Promotion Hall. The site is now part of Hiroshima Peace Memorial Park, the rubble from impact left unperturbed within the fenced in compound.

If one were to be constructive we might look back at it as a moment of catharsis from which we might then come together rebuild and move forward. Heaven knows that there was enough sovereign criminal complicity to go around but its always the innocent who are made to pay the price. A century on from the causes of that war (widespread depression and hyperinflation), now would be a good time to have a hard look at the *very* pinnacle of our 'western' leadership and ask hard questions. How far has liberal democracy evolved? Or has it degenerated into farce? What exactly are we all still looking for in the way of reparation, remuneration, compensation, accountability for past sins from each other? The promise of a cool million could not adequately compensate me for indignity of a minute spent in the company of the trial lawyers and their magistrate - whether I was rightfully owed it or not. Such is my own contempt for the hegemon. Pax Americana can keep its lawfare as well as its warfare. It amounts to more or less the same thing; moral and literal bankruptcy - the cheque wouldn't be worth the paper it is written on. Anyone who has spent nights in jail for no good reason knows it. That's what my twenty-five years of high-quality education in history, political science and economy - and another twenty-five in information technology has taught me. Now,I have a considerable affection for my own country and our response to the end of World War II's  hostilities was I think appropriate; the deliberate renunciation of a nuclear weapons capability (which we did in fact possess) and even home-grown offensive aeronautical capability (above: the [Avro Arrow](https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/avro-arrow)). However one cannot choose our neighbours and alas here we (along with Mexico) regrettably forced into being 'aligned' to a country whose President celebrates his election by issuing a camouflaged [bible](https://godblesstheusabible.com/collections/frontpage) as though he were a hybrid combination of monarch and pope (left: image shared by the President earlier this month). I note with considerable alacrity that several of these American beauties are sold out - but thankfully not the camouflaged one - collect yours while supplies last.

There are times now, being a Canadian (rather than just English as I once was) when I wish I had never been born and so that I might not have had children who must endure life under thoughtless men in the service of sovereigns who pay tribute to America and its agents of government and law. That I might have had a choice in this great existential question and instead of taking it had instead the opportunity to generously bestow it on someone else. But here I am and it's a sin to look back and regret decisions that I was never a party to (my birth); a pointless rumination if ever there was one. Until we have the technology as a country to drift calmly to a safer corner of the Universe what I can do is turn myself to those things in the world that I know to be evil and ask what I might to do change them - even if it is simply by not being a party to them; to stop taking from this planet's fragile lot including from America's needy grasp. I increasingly model reality as myself alone on earth with one large  wallet as company; I invoke this bifurcation in my pieces on self-sovereignty ([Opportunity ](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/self-sovereignty?blogcategory=Peridot+(Illumination))and [Substance](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/self-sovereign---2-the-nature?blogcategory=Peridot+(Illumination))). I wish it would vanish. I have at least that enough agency to ensure that I do not contribute into it so that it may assemble further ordinances - bound for Crimea, Gaza or Kashmir - or even just to bolster quarterly results for Lockheed Martin, Raytheon or Northrup Grumman. In fact, I've changed my name to Ashit Milne so as not to be confused with [Kash Patel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kash_Patel) or even vaguely affiliated with him and his mission - whatever it is (I was once widely known as Ash Patel.*).

I could retire into the wilderness or into the breast of some kind community of souls who seek solace with each other amidst the nation-states created in America's image living as though they were irrelevant and in doing so make it so. I write this even as I grapple with the pain (and pride) of learning that my own children have the insight to who asks the same question: How they might not exist *this* close to America. It will take everything I have to radiate genuine positivity - for myself - because that is the source of their anxiety - my utter lack of enthusiasm and indeed for life in such close proximity to the Great Santa. That someone with such gifts as those that I have been granted would consider checking out of so-called liberal democratic 'free west' that they somehow think 'works'. In an echo of the vibe I felt in those schools, it's my task now to keep my *own* chin up - for the sake my daughters.

**Call And Response**

![img](//img1.wsimg.com/isteam/ip/674c7aa6-fcc2-4283-a438-de467701f51c/Mishima-san.png/:/cr=t:0%25,l:0%25,w:100%25,h:100%25/rs=w:1280)Edit Image

Nihilism is the chasm that lies between truth (Satya) and beauty (Sundar) when that gap isn't or can't be minded by the divine (Shivam) within; when as a babe it first looks out at the world seeking equivalence (validation and acceptance) from without and it is instead left wanting. A call is issued from an embodied soul and the world signals a response, initially from an increasingly beleaguered and lonely mother. That is the moment when a dissonance between the perceived truth and the felt 'beauty' (or the lack thereof) may register in the soul as nihilism; beginning as the small fragment of disappointment, dejection and alienation. What am I to do with you child now that you are in this forsaken world of fabricated scarcity? A sacred why is left unanswered leaving a mystery gaping inside - the beginning of nihilism. Then, regimented and marshalled the child enters adulthood and fracture grows into the chasm of a numb runaround manic 'week is why'; then Friday arrives and we dance into the fire of broken dreams with a fatal kiss. Is it any wonder then that [Mishima ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yukio_Mishima)(left) 'protested' seeing his country's elegant aesthetic fall under the rubric of drab bureaucratic regimentation? Weeks, months and years inevitably end in futile [karoshi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karoshi). His once fierce proud nation now docile, submissive and emasculated. The country was once again made 'prosperous' after the war but something greater than materiality was gone. Honour, dignity and culture. You can see how having experienced the atomic holocaust at age 20 why he might have decided to make a *fine point* of objecting to his culture's decline under American hegemony. Is it really that much different anywhere else in this 'dollar' regime? It's all money gum, only our accents change. It doesn't take a socialist to realize we have the capital to afford our children true freedom from their first breath and I can only believe that our intransigence in offering it them is that we prefer them enslaved to a corporatist nation-state.

I'll say it again, I don't care to elect, I elect to care. We must and can do better and it is why I have set about on this inquiry into values and human-centric systems. Reading this, I'm sure you come away at least appreciating what nihilism entails even if you still yet can't fully define it you still felt it. When democracy becomes a puerile pantomime it's not a far reach to feel that 'nothing matters'. My own view is that the little credence we still yet lend to our institutions is borne of sentimentality and keeps us from reforming them - that is how far gone they are. Forgive me - I know it's not an easy message to receive and it pains me to deliver it and it takes *a lot* out of me. I suppose  Hiroshima left its mark on me and it's one reason I chose not to climb the ladders placed before me - only so far as I could still relate in human terms to the teams delivering the work I managed. My aim here though is to awaken in you an appetite for something different - and for those we thoughtlessly bring war to. A planet worth raising children on. What do you choose? Temptation and a dance into the fire or instead truth and beauty aligned in [attraction](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/attraction?blogcategory=Peridot+(Illumination))? If we are to have nation-states in the 'free world' at all let them be truly independent of an increasingly boarish hegemon.

*I endorsed Donald Trump for President (I preferred Nikki Haley and Bobby Kennedy as their parties respective candidates) but in the world we live in I suppose we could do and worse than Mr. Trump and crypto was my priority (even as WH positions on it appear to be incoherent). I also watch with dismay the glacial progress of an imperfect bill that will get properly front-run. You can imagine how I feel about the previous 'Democratic' administration. It's not so much the lack of a coherent strategy and even intransigence on monetary governance (which is actually at the root of so much conflict in the world - paper cash management in particular for crime, money laundering and terrorism); I hold them accountable for the lapses that led to the Hamas incursions into Israel, the green light on bombing Gaza given in retaliation - and the war in Crimea. I mark the Biden Administration out as quite possibly the worst peacetime administration in US History and certainly the worst in my lifetime (at least Nixon had the common sense and decency to resign). The notion that the Biden administration should continue (with his deputy at the helm) was appalling. I even laid a $300 USDC bet (while in London - Ontario prohibits it) in the Summer of 2023 on Polymarket for Trump to lose the Republican nomination and Bobby to win the Democratic one. More out of a forlorn hope that humanity had after all some capacity for redemption and reason than any hope I had of actually winning. That feeling persists - *that* is optimism. Yet here we are with talk of military parades, AI generated pictures, pencils, dolls. But look at this way - it's actually a massive improvement! Better an AI Catholic than a cafeteria one. I'll say this much, the President is improvisational and creative (and I'm given to engaging, in my own limited corner, in the same sorts of '[Monkey Wrench Gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monkey_Wrench_Gang)' shenanigans - more focused on assaulting sovereign credibility and corporate social media than material capital and without access to [Cantillon](https://www.adamsmith.org/blog/the-cantillion-effect) (I prefer to say 'cantillion' - because it rhyme with bajillion) that foots the bill for military parades and the like - I more of a minimalist).

You can see how taste is a heuristic for the quality of human civilization and just how wide the chasm between truth and beauty has become at western liberal democracy's elite level (the White House): "So, that's three dolls, five pencils (quite reasonable actually) and a $90 million military parade on your birthday. Would you like an order of Freedom Fries with that?"
