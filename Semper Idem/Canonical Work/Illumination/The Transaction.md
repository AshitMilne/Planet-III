Above: Canadian coinage. I highly recommend a visit to the [Royal Canadian Mint](https://www.mint.ca/en?rcmeid=Agency_PBM_SEM_71700000075106880_58700006463377440_p58419888311&&msclkid=141488ee0ebd1ea4955ee0bdedd6e25f&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=CAN-Core-Branded&utm_term=royal canadian mint&utm_content=Core Branded - Exact&gclid=141488ee0ebd1ea4955ee0bdedd6e25f&gclsrc=3p.ds&gad_source=7) in Ottawa if you visit the nation's capital - one of the world's most technologically advanced. Over 70 countries outsource their money-tech needs to Canada. In *our* country primary denominations for circulation are still alloy measured with precision. It's the global standard for sound fiat currency for those who know money (hence why the 51st State bollocks earlier this year).

**Author’s Note** This is a reframing of the transaction as a notion in the social sciences (particularly political-economy). Its purpose is to prime you to think about basic income—paid by or at least on a secure network running smart contracts enabled on stablecoin rails for example; this, of course, allows for guardrails (direction) on how distributed money is spent (fresh produce, shelter and staples), as well digital product  where the price of intellectual property delivered online though nil to negligible nevertheless provides attention-based returns to their creators.

The idea is to provide a person with the space and time to discover their *Calling*: their innate capabilities, as well as those things, places, and people to which they are drawn. It is also to develop holistic attributes of personal hygiene: introspection, empathy, reason—together with foundational intellectual, tactile, and kinetic capabilities.*

It would be available—perhaps starting as a basic income of $20,000 to the digital wallet of an expectant mother—incrementally growing as a child develops and matures to a point where they are provably capable of managing their wallets. At this point, it becomes their allowance, developing into their own basic income as the dependent approaches 18.The scenerio assumes the availability of a community (perhaps a multigenerational home, the availability, even part-time of a second parent - but not necessarily a partner).

No condition (save perhaps wage employment at an enterprise exceeding 150 employees) would result in the withdrawal of the basic income. Partnership or enterprise—in the trades, small-hold agriculture, or the industrial and creative arts (with pedagogy as a universal skillset developed in an apprenticeship ecology)—would be fostered as alternatives to twentieth-century style wage employment.

Income beyond $80,000 would be reclaimed by the network (restaked to secure 0-Layer consensus priorities—perhaps with considerable direction from the source). That’s the idea in broad strokes.

The potential here is profound—not only for unleashing creativity and productivity in aggregate, but also for truly restorative leisure. This is also an existential imperative, because we live in a post-industrial world for which our current frameworks for human development—particularly for the young—are antiquated: geared for regimentation in industry (blue- or white-collar) rather than the cultivation and expression of the radically diverse range of thought required to overcome our most intractable problems.

As well, it allows for:

- a) extraordinary breadth choice concerning the amount of effort and energy appropriately expended to actualize *Calling* and so enabling personal sustainability, and therefore also...
- b) aggregate sustainability as well

We’ll explore this further in *Regnum Dei – 2: Policia*, where the architecture of a post-sovereign—or, as I prefer, *self-sovereign*—post-scarcity order begins to take form. There’s no reason why a white-label dApp could not be developed and rolled out by public or private initiatives (from the anarchist perspective the distinction is, in any case, invalid), with modification to suit use-case (or administrative mandate).

**A Systems Approach to Understanding Transactions**

Another heart has made the trade Forget it, forget it, forget it I don't understand how a heart is a spade But somehow, the vital connection is made 

Riding on anything Anything's good enough Who would've thought it of Someone like you? Just as they brought me round Now that they brought you down Roundabout and roundabout Who wants a life anyway? 

Another heart has made the grade Forget it, forget it, forget it I don't understand how the last card is played But somehow, the vital connection is made 

~ *Elastica* ([Connnection](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ilKcXIFi-Rc&list=RDilKcXIFi-Rc&start_radio=1))

On the heels of rediscovering the esoteric meaning of 'trade' I now want to introduce an alternative approach to thinking about to transactions those events that in aggregate make up our connection to the commons; both in the narrow monetary sense and as well broadly, the data from interactions of all kind that we have with the world and its various actors; recalling an idea I expressed [earlier ](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/nihilism?blogcategory=Peridot+(Illumination))our relationship to the world is developed one transaction at a time from the moment we are born; over time developing into a path that lies somewhere between nihilism and a deluded sense of living in the best of all possible (western liberal democratic) worlds. A 'happy' middle path is the self-sovereign one that for me at least entails considerable satisfaction, contentment and leisure. What's required is for one to adjust how transactions are modeled. 

There is no such thing as ‘subjective’ truth — only a vantage point. How *effective* it is depends on well it a) models reality and b) serves your self-interest over the long haul with c) automaticity and little effort but an enormous *sense of* abundance as an output. With that in mind I'll introduce the (positive sum) 'Give and Go' and a replacement for the (zero sum) 'Give and Take'.

When thou wouldst cheer thine heart, think upon the good qualities of thy associates; as for instance, this one's energy, that one's modesty, the generosity of a third, and some other trait of a fourth. For nothing is so cheering as the images of the virtues mirrored in the characters of those who live with us, and presenting themselves in as great throng as possible. Have these images then ever before thine eyes.

~ Marcus Aurelius Book VI - 49

**The Give and Go**

Is to be contrasted with the traditional idea that we 'give and take' whilst in the midst of a transaction. This is because we see ourselves immersed in the system or network as an 'agent' even as we try to examine it. This results in a narrow viewpoint that is systemically sub-optimal and incomplete as a frame of reference.

Imagine yourself having an 'out of the body' experience and becoming an indifferent observer to a transaction with a comprehensive system view - and a long time horizon. What you may then see are numerous parties that give and then move on (go) to do so again and again. You might imagine parties as vehicles in traffic passing each other imparting some experience. This perspective allows for a far more fluid, dynamic and systemic model than the usual 'give and take'. It also lends the idea of journey and the notion and we are all going towards some destination; Martin Luther King's long arc of justice - that sense of linearity and our collective pilgrim's progress that, notwithstanding all the volatility through the ages, allows our optimism to persist, as well the idea we will prevail - and at last overcome the tyranny of the 'styled' sovereign's hegemony.

I'll give you an example from football. Imagine a right-back, full-back and keeper trying to play out from the back but being pinned down by an opponent's press, the fans growing increasingly frustrated with the stagnant play. They 'give and take' the ball between them passing deftly perhaps (you might even enjoy watching their neat technique if they were on the training ground and that's what you'd come to observe) but here in a competitive fixture of 90 minutes the activity doesn't appear to have any sense of direction or vision and appears to be shorn of objective. Those who watch regularly will recognize this immediately and almost feel anxious - the groans and jeers from the assembled 50,000-odd rising and the atmosphere becoming increasingly unpleasant and uncomfortable.**

Now instead imagine these three players along with those who *do not have the ball* being  active participants looking for an opportunity to 'step up', slip into space, making eye contact communicating with deft non-verbal cues - the drop of a shoulder and elbow pointed in a direction. In a way, momentarily each sees and takes an opportunity to *lead.* It's not the comic-book or fairy tale idea of leadership you see on LinkedIn or the nightly news from the G7 Summit or Davos or the joint communique concerning the conflict between Wherever-the-Fuckistan and the Democratic Republic of Mongo. This is something different - as though each is tuned in and poised and ready to pounce on an opportunity to *contribute - to have a go - and give*. You may note one or two players stand out in particular from whom the rest take their flow (and these will likely not be the ones selecting the order from the menu at dinner tonight and they will almost certainly not be the ones asking investment advise from the quiet journeymen currently warming the substitute's bench). Meanwhile the opposing players do likewise. Collaborating in their pressing game. One perspective is that it's 'competitive' which it is but another sees it as a dance between partners in a microcosm of life - a spectacle of each pushing and pulling the other so that together they are something more than they were in the preceding moment much to the world's delight. 

It may or may not lead to goals but it offers a true spectacle. Something worth watching and being a part of. Even, dare I say, makes you feel as though you are part of something greater whether you're watching or playing you come away with the feeling of having shared an 'experience'. You know what this is like. You're flushed and you just all look each other laughing and shaking your heads, utterly in love with each other and the world.

**The Money Tree**

These things happen when inner monologue is quieted and flow is allowed to conduct the proceedings. Elsewhere I've offered examples, riffing on David Graeber's work, of how this sort of behaviour likely enabled communities to thrive prehistorically where instead of seeing self-preservation in a narrow sense we saw it broadly as the preservation of the collective - the commons and now in the Anthropocene an imperative for us is to extend that past humanity to include creation. What was different then versus now is that tone, priority and direction was set from the very top of the collective; in fact that was how we identified the 'top' (dynamic as it was in terms of personality, notionally it balanced and pirouetted on this idea of the 'system' or 'architecture' above all else. It consequently radiated a charisma that fused the collective while giving it directional velocity (purpose and meaning). You'll hear at times the need to 'balance' so-called Darwinist competition and the collectivist or collaborative spirit (sometimes couched as dovetailing male and female energies - a particularly fraught lens at this moment). I say, put that all that away as useful and instructive as it is, it too often devolves into left versus right and red versus blue - that conversation's been had with far greater quality ad nauseum for millennia since Aristotle - and nothing anyone has said this century to elevate it. Instead zoom out and take a systems perspective, *if you deign to lead;* because that's what's required: clearly bounded secure systems that contain (hold) all of us without exception. Existentialism requires it.

This is how a sovereign views transactions. A true sovereign only thinks of what may be offered before one is gone. Even in terms of conquest, it's a matter of bequeathing something else technologically or genetically or culturally - a superior mechanism for governance. *However it fails as soon as the lead perspective narrows to the self and its own lifespan.* The sovereign feasts, if at all, last and eats the least (that's how good, how productive, how able to make much of so little he is. Otherwise he's on the take and a fraud. He doesn't shake the money tree. He *is* the money tree.

**Practical Implications**

How do we put this into practice in real terms? You start by asking why? Why do anything at all? Why. Because it's fun? Why is it fun? You come away feeling better -  having grown the sense of *being* more (and not having more - because you've spent time you demonstrably cannot 'double spend'). As well you have imparted the same sensation to others otherwise you'd feel ill or 'off' - nobody healthy takes when they might instead put themselves in a position of giving constantly.

What else? Well, as I've implied in [Imprimatur ](https://transition-insight.com/?blogcategory=Imprimatur+(Tout+Suite))a lot of it comes down reducing your own participation in the addiction to consumption (which is devouring this planet unsustainably without really leaving us any happier).

As well you take radical responsibility for your wellness; for me includes not only adherence to an objectively valid fitness and nutritional regime but also foregoing anything in the way of care that burdens the commons. It is however another thing for the 'styled' sovereign to insist one enjoy his hospitality. I have in fact had the 'pleasure' and cannot recommend it. Lord know there are enough red, brown and black men in there without me adding my model minority [ars](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/kyc->-cya?blogcategory=Brevis+(Dropping+Briefs)) to mix. Do you what you can to avoid being segregated from white folk by your particular western liberal democratic government.

Finally, you may receive a wage for work you hopefully get real meaning and value out of (I certainly did - and it diminished over time as my capabilities and attributes accumulated naturally - that's why we move on from a particular role and eventually from a career - and ultimately even a paradigm for work itself). Even if you don't care for your job, see the wage as a mechanism to purchase a degree of satisfaction to be derived elsewhere; at a climbing gym, taking a painting or tactical self-defence class or an improv. class perhaps. Anything that gives you a sense of growth and personal development; perhaps these things 'round you out' as a human and make you more tenable as someone to be with (as a companion, colleague, partner or parent) and so allow you to transition to work that does appeal to you. Ultimately your goal is to need as little of it and earn as little of it as possible (choose to earn provably scarce Solana or Ethereum instead - it is volatile but again if you take the long view it is demonstrably unassailably sound money). So that you can give something of value and ask nothing in return for it.

**A Caretaker Mentality**

This framework for transactions is how I expect shared by most intelligent and yet still 'conventionally' successful people. They aren't generally 'in it' for the money and view capital accumulation as giving them the prospect for greater leverage as they look to meta-form civilization (this is in and of itself problematic - they're playing at God and they represen a risk to humanity and it's why the immitation of Christ (manifesting Christ-consciousness is such an imperative for us - however you want to frame it - what I mean is of course an alignment to *natural* order and intelligence). It's why I call them giants. Where many of them struggle is with ego, attachment, the penchant for opulence (that on the whole fails to give satisfaction), a desire for title and rank that infer exclusivity for its own sake - and as well a fear of death (and its counterparts in liveness - shame and embarrassment). It's unclear to me why so many people have a problem with these. Lean into them - except death obviously. My own perspective on that one is to look forward to it as a once in a lifetime opportunity that cannot be missed - an absolute must. It's a caretaker's mentality - we manage risk exceedingly well without actually minding about the consequences. Because we're too small to fail we invariably win big and incremental grow the capability of winning every moment. Critical to a true sovereign perspective is the willingness to receive death now - in fact even better is the insistence that it hasn't arrived on-time as promised but that one will nevertheless maintain mental and physical acuity so that it may be well-received one day (as something truly earned and worth rather than a mercy killing). 

The narrative best adopted here, one that is *useful* rather than provably true, is that you're doing humanity a favour by sticking around and that your time (eternity) would be better served immersed in Creation. While eternity may be a long time, you'd prefer it start sooner rather than later because humanity was a fine and interesting experience but it's time to move on. You are in fact, God's gift to mankind because you take so little and give so much (remember 'give and go'). This of course needs to be true otherwise it doesn't really work. The good news here is that the very worst thing that can happen when you're gone is the rest of humanity turn the planet into another Marsit does actually need you - which in the grand universal scheme of things isn't particularly consequential from Creation's perspective - humanity hasn't even approached level pegging with the world's most successful apex fauna in terms of longevity - and if I were putting on the commentators hat and remarking from the sidelines I'd say it appears to be on it's way to a spectacular 'DNF' - admittedly memorable in some ways I suppose). 

Now that is an affirmation worth living for mate. Remember above all else, one tends to lose, and painfully at that, the very things that are most preciously held and that you are most attached to; you are developing the subtle capability of caring for yourself and for the world without minding what happens. You give - for as long as you can with optimal capability - and then you go. This is the path to contentment.

~ Ashit Milne (Planet Come Together).

** **Tactile** refers to *touch*, *fine motor skills*, and *sensitivity*. This includes things like dexterity, craftsmanship, working with your hands, or even tactile perception (e.g., a sculptor, woodworker, or massage therapist). **Kinetic** refers to *movement*, *gross motor function*, and *body dynamics*. This involves coordination, balance, strength, and locomotion — think dancers, martial artists, or athletes.

**Another way to think of this—one that resembles high-frequency trading in its relentless, purposeless flicker across the bid/ask spread—is the game of 'piggy in the middle.' But here it’s played by two big boys, with a smaller, desperately hopeful kid stuck in the middle. He has the temerity to believe the rules are fair—that he might actually get the ball. But just as he gets close, the big boys call on the Fed or the regulators to intervene—change the rules, move the goalposts, or simply take the ball (or the kid) away altogether.
