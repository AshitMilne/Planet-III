It closes and, turned inward, seeks to find and actuate *Calling*. The turmoil of the ROI-ling stone then ensues as personal reconciliation as the search for meaning begins. The anarchist moves in a jungle where the sovereign (to left) has lethal power wielded clumsily in an open-looped 'mechanism'. It delegates authority without sound governance to unsupervised unqualified subjects and so proliferates access to its founding and floundering contract: Ungoverned money.

**Context: Scope and Posture**

I'm presenting *my* personal worldview below and I do not insist it to be legitimate for anyone save me. 

The scope of this framework is the US dollar regime. My posture to the US dollar regime is neutral and de-escalatory (hands up with palms facing out):* The surrender in principle of 'property' (notional and material) without resistance. I give up *those* things because to the sovereign I am dispensable and they have reserved for themselves the ultimate right to claim eminent domain and resistance of any kind by one to an entity that monopolizes coercive power (soft and hard) is futile.

The world beyond the dollar regime will treat me as neutral (fungible and interchangeable) but makes no claim of eminent domain on my person. I do not expect coercion from them because I break no laws *anywhere*. My posture to the world beyond the dollar regime is 'friendly' (hands at sides). Why assumed friendly? Because we share a belief that democracy (such as it exists in the west) has lost legitimacy; indeed it's why so-called leaders in the west spend so much time calling out perceived violations in (transparently) authoritarian regimes (although their standards are changing - there was a time when Singapore was a favourite American punching bag).

**The Black (Self- Sovereign) - An Anarchist Perspective of Social Reality**

Let's define, from an anarchist perspective two concepts The Sovereign (Government) and the Subject (Citizen) and the central issue for anarchist: That nothing tethers the commons and creation to an objectively valid and globally acceptable point of reference for value. This is obvious and I have expressed it in a variety of ways but it essentially comes down to the fact that the US dollar is not tied to anything of real value since the end of the unwritten petrodollar agreement with Saudi that it only accept US dollars from all counterparties for oil. 

Following the agreement's expiration, Saudi Arabia has begun accepting other major currencies for oil transactions, including the Chinese Renminbi (RMB), Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY) as well as Bitcoin. It is also collaborating on [mBridge](https://www.bis.org/about/bisih/topics/cbdc/mcbdc_bridge.htm), a collaborative effort exploring a digital currency platform shared among central banks and commercial banks. This initiative aims to facilitate instant cross-border payments and foreign-exchange transactions using distributed ledger technology.

Closer to home in our ordinary daily lives the dollar still has power to influence individual decision making. From an anarchist perspective anyone using it is potentially dangerous (hence my de-escalatory stance outlined above).

**The White** (**Subject**): People who go about their lives with the very contained focus of working a job and enjoying the remaining time with loved ones and anything from which they may derive a degree of self-actualization; they will not invest considerable time on developing a broad abstract understanding of global political economy and have no obvious reason to doubt the success of liberal democracy.

There are too, those who quietly acquiesce either in complacency or astute but fearful acknowledgement that they are 'collateral' in the eyes of those who wield influence and power so even they will focus on self-preservation and self-interest. They may pivot with creative positivity to discover whatever opportunities the reality may afford. Since basic contracts (including currency) are no longer legitimate they will begin to struggle as the *fin de siecle* fourth turning regime begins to falter decisively.

**Lichen Fade\** #808040** (**Sovereign**): This is a blended combination of the colours used by Thomson Erikson to categorize persona into four types, represented by the colours red, yellow, green and blue, to manifest different forms of intelligence (or the lack thereof) in [Surrounded By Idiots](https://www.amazon.ca/Surrounded-Idiots-Behavior-Effectively-Communicate/dp/1250179939/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1)***.  Psychopathy can be seen as *another* type of personality (a giant) that stands apart entirely and looks upon society as a blend of all four colours; something to be manipulated. In here I place sovereign military and intelligence frameworks. War after all is the one place where we arbitrarily kill another for pay, rank and honours. Also here are tiny fraction who are willfully manipulative - the psychopaths among us. As well you can place that coterie who revolve through senior private or public office. They have a degree of immunity to due process granted to their person in perpetuity; their stature amounts to royalty - which you can see by the steady procession of offspring and spouses who follow them or attempt to do so. I fashion them [giants](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/risperidone---the-fate-of-the-gods?blogcategory=Peridot+(Illumination)). 

Appropriately this is the colour of military fatigues worn where the context for killing will always be self-defense which is why it entails so much trauma. Nobody with a sense of humanity wants an excuse to kill others (never mind needs one). In practical terms because authority as been so profoundly delegated everyone not an anarchist is Lichen Fade and may be considered opportunistic to your detriment.

Trudeau the Elder Pirouettes Away

From an anarchist perspective we are 'headless'.  The commons are a Lichen Fade jungle in which the subject is vulnerable to predation even it he cack-handedly takes a turn at predation himself.

This is where proof-of-stake protocols come into play as we move look to building governance frameworks with greater legitimacy that is derived from objectively optimal outcomes delivered by canvasing broader constituencies recognized for their subject matter expertise through consensus. 

In the meantime citizenship in reality means being subject to the whims of those ensconced in sovereign hierarchy (Lichen Fade) through heritage and inheritance. Subjects have surrendered to a life of staying in their lane until it is dead-ended. They may pivot to find something else for as long as they are allowed. Anarchy understands that a quiet consensus of disparate strands in society can pull together coalitions with sub-optimal outcomes for one and for the commons if not properly governed. 

In time *inconvenient* nodes of influence and truth telling will get canceled to protect existing frameworks that have been found to be so compromised that general alarm now prevails and one tactical kluge after another is applied to an increasingly fraught system. This is the progress of cancel culture beginning to reach a fine point; appearing incongruent to anything organically intelligent it is terrifyingly coercive in a world of massive data flow and even feels out of control. The self-sovereign's response is straightforward; it cannot take for granted that purpose or calling will be allowed to actuate and it needs to be self-sufficient even as it works as a positive agent for change.

*The posture here is the Krav Maga tactical self-defence starting position facing an *apparently* adversarial counterparty (someone holding a knife or gun and demanding surrender): Squared, dominant leg forward, palms up (almost jazz hands) with dominant hand forward, nodding acceptance and acknowledgement of circumstance with a calm empathetic demeanour. Krav does not bring a 'stand your ground' attitude to conflict; 'things' are neither worth dying nor killing for - nor even worth getting injured for. Anyone desperate enough to confront you with a weapon for your possessions clearly needs them more than you - hand them over. Carrying firearm or even a knife (outside of hunting or other such pursuits) is an invitation to trouble; suspicion has led to an escalation of fungible power between the civilian and those entrusted with law enforcement. In an urban context a phone in closed-fist works well enough if it comes to it. My own instinct is that since 9/11 the hegemonic sovereign (and its giants) has become at the minimum guarded and even hostile towards non-state actors (individuals) who can influence opinion (even with only force of persuasive reasoned and intuitively sound discursive argument). Personhood and the violation of one's self-sovereignty cannot be allowed and that's why those of us who have learned to use lethal force have done so - to defend our person or develop philosophically abstractions of true value; this then allows us to manoeuvre within exploitive contexts - namely modern reality - (corporatist) liberal democracy - with a degree of comfort.  

Change in our governance models are required and an understanding of their problematic qualities are even well understood; however there is contention with incumbent stakeholders at the core; it's not quite [Hunger Games](https://scifi.stackexchange.com/questions/74301/is-the-three-fingered-salute-from-the-hunger-games-trilogy-based-on-something-fr) but you get the idea. The internet is a powerful tool and the world is calling out for substantive solutions to intractable problems; anyone outlining them is going to get 'stick' for any number of reasons that have to.

**Lichen a fungus you will find on rocks and trees; though edible and sustaining in the short term it is unpleasant nor ultimately satisfying. I use it here as a pun; it's the mentality of the chameleon everything to everyone retail entity- they'll take 'a likin' to ya' then 'fade ya' as it suits them; whatever it takes to secure them their  'consensus' and their maintain their capital, revenue streams, and a *public* social credit that may not bear scrutiny (cash, favours, crypto can all play a role in a mechanism for exchanging due consideration surreptitiously.

**Not that IQ quotient is devoid of signal, I prefer models that acknowledge diversity as not only a reality but an opportunity to aggregate a broader more encompassing notion of intelligence. We see truth from different angles and the finger pointing to the moon is not the moon (buddha nature). Subjectively, there are seven billion utterly valid perspectives and objectivity therefore is complex and must be derived systemically so as not to entail bias. You'll see reflections of what I'm sketching out in the abstraction of identity with Dial Square here as we aim to design credibly neutral *systems* for governance but of course not *persons -* where we need credibility not neutrality - leave this to the *Machina* system; I don't dismiss the need for diversity, equity and inclusion - I just do not trust the bias implicit within our institutions to deliver it comprehensively for obvious reasons that they still draw distinction between red and blue arbitrarily.
