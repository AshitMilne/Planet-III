**Introduction**: Machina presented the world as an 'OK' Computer - one that was complete with God deeply embedded within before complexity of civilization began to arise. Its intelligence is natural. Anima on the other hand sees the world as bifurcated. In a sense our Paranoid Android has forked from Creation and increasingly talking in polarizing dualist terms such as 'Nature versus Nurture' and other dualist concepts. On the one hand there is the playful world that delight without the modern human - stunning vistas to leave you breathless and the joyful antics of baby animals. On the other hand within humanity anima becomes animus; a place gripping ever larger tits yet paradoxically fearful of scarcity rears itself on Instagram and Facebook; it cannot see its way to gratitude for readily apparent abundance - and is yet desperately keen to show us what a good time it's having running the show. The banality and chaos is comprehensive. Evident too is their concern that many of us aren't envious enough of their automobiles and homes for western civilization to function as it should.

Still the notion of Anima requires those of us who have 'forked from the fork' to work creatively and even playfully (translation: have fun) in our re-imagined spaces. Civilization needs most of all those who are intelligent, curious and acutely aware of our challenges - and are still excited at the prospect of building an extraordinarily beautiful future. 

## Is It Yoga? ##

*Like the flower and the scent of summer like the sun and shine Well the truth may come in strange disguises Send the message to your mind. Tattva, achyntia-bheda-abheda-tattva.*

~ Kula Shaker ([Tattva](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2bYj2o7y4rk)) 

The word *tattva* in Sanskrit translates to "principle," "truth," or "essence." It refers to the fundamental reality or the essential nature of something. In Indian philosophy, *tattva* is used to describe foundational principles of existence or elements of the universe. In spiritual or philosophical contexts, *tattva* denotes the true nature of reality or a principle underlying existence, aiming to reveal deeper truths about self, life, and consciousness. Yoga is the practice of yoking self to creation. In India the Sannyasin was the contemplative who are after much deliberate introspection (a self-discussion in stillness without voice) and having seen through the pantomime of the commons and its manufactured costumed fiction would walk out of it to wander un-costumed, performatively their transparent nakedness was their costume: an unspoken satyagraha that spoke truth to civilization's rigidly caste power structures. They saw no way to bridge the chasm between the vast fraud without and what they themselves had seen within and they walked out. 

That's the ideal. Now civilization is such that it encourages the opportunistic mime and meme. Lucifer enlightens and seeing the opportunity for indolence and licentiousness a melee ensues - conferences are even organized on civilization's calendars for the purpose. Shiv, the patron of yogis however is a *Sufi* - a seeker but self-sufficient one in a metaphorical solitude as an archetype and as platonic example of what it means to retire (merely to be in one's own company as a palliative and practice. To to seek an understanding of self - and then bring it back to humanity with *Calling* as God's gift. This is a practice to be cultivated as a component of life in the midst of culture.

To walk out on a problem *entirely* is irresponsible. That is literally the meaning of the word - to reject an opportunity to take up the responsibility of exploiting an opportunity to resolve matters for our corner of Anima (or Gaia) - humanity. There are other ways to renounce an incumbent system while continuing to introspect with awareness, discover communities of people who having made a similar transition, and continue to build in civilization and the commons in ways that will allow us to align with our greater ecology.

One reason I left the practice of yoga (as it is known in the west) is precisely because I found it increasingly performative, aesthetic and even, narcissistic. It is literally full of posers - and those naively mesmerized by the pose of one leading them on. The best teachers though (my own for example) were in contrast modest, self-effacing, humble yet powerful examples of how to 'be'. Leaving them was difficult.

My own feeling is that the extravagant knots of the original sannyasin were presented as a mocking satire - a frightful mirror inspired by Kali and shown to a messy and disturbing society: the same problems were clear to the thoughtful (and cheeky yogi) thousands of years ago as they are now. This is a subtlety lost on those bending themselves painfully into some extremely weird poses unnecessarily and those assisting them into torn hamstrings. That said, I came away with some clever ideas as I shifted to urban and wilderness protocols and methods - strategic and tactical. These tune awareness in the world much as introspection does in the quiet warm moments before dawn where I cultivated a seated vipassana practice - I needed to slow down.

All of this as an alternative political-economy began to evolve in the world;  A platform where I might apply my professional *and* intellectual ambitions. I fancied myself paradoxically as simultaneously the sharp point of an arrow as well as the mark it was aimed for coming full circle to understand to fully understand my objectives for the first time. 



 











The process of coming to awareness requires us to interpret creation's flow (*Dhara), 'hold a lamp' (*Diya*) to it in order clarify or filter truth, and then actualize meaningful change deliberately with vision (*Drishti*). 

This is the idea of 'masculine' and 'feminine' energy in yoga; the Sun and Moon respectively heating and cooling together maintain the Planet in equilibrium as it travels.  Yoga extends the idea of holistic regulation in the associated philosophy of Ayurveda. Where one of three constitutions; Vata (Ether and Air) is responsible for movement, circulation, respiration, and nerve function. The other two are Pitta (Fire and Water) and Kapha (Earth and Water). The manifestation of balance in nature requires all three to be in equilibrium with Vata automating governance, heating and cooling, our behaviour to actuate a sustainable balance. Vata's Ether aspect amounts to the 'spaces within us and the ones we create between us' - the ones we were so concerned about during the lockdown. Humanity draws from Air, Fire and Earth, combining it with Ether to generate [*flow* ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mihaly_Csikszentmihalyi) *to* create productively since the beginning. Holistically, in modern civilization, humanity needs a mechanism to regulate currency - that which flow between us - to manage scarce resources sustainably and assure perpetual abundance - [s*ine qua non*](https://transition-insight.com/?blogcategory=Sine+Qua+Non+(Humanity+%26+AI))  - without which, (there is) nothing for humans who wish to 'be' over the long run. 

My daughters names are Dhara, Diya and Drishti. I'm guiding Drishti, my youngest, a budding 16 year-old coder, to communities that explore technologies that riff on these existential notions to create a more holistic utility for our information technology, mostly through dinner conversations on political-economy. We assiduously avoid retail politics. I have my own views on the 2024 US Election and while my daughters' opinions are starkly different, I not only tolerate and understand them but having raised them, seeing the world from their vantage and being staked in their future - as women - I can embrace them. We have different 'energies', outlooks and perspectives.

## Into The Ether of Mind ##

*Gaia (or Anima)* is a myth *larger* than life - relevant even before life existed *for us*. We have myths to model *complex* social systems in context the way we model chemistry, physics and biology with those cute physical models in class. Vata is breath and Ether our interstitial aspect of inhalation/exhalation and expansion/contraction; one that needs credible and neutral expression in our technological architecture so that we may set an objective price to what we collectively need to value (including how time and notional capital is applied).

**The Dao of Capital**

*Now you're at the wheel Tell me how, how does it feel? So good to have equalized To lift up the lids of your eyes* 

*~* The Stone Roses (Waterfall)

As a counterpoint to stillness there is motion and in creation it expresses a stillness that flows (*being* without toil). Just as yoga directs us to be inaction in action, so to the Dao's invocation is to be *in* vocation. The *Dao De Ching* counsels us to be like the water as it falls to it destination. For those of you in technology think of those waterfall projects. Remember how we used traceability in setting out a 'token' of value for the customer- a functional or non-functional requirement? Then carry it through the BRD (Business Requirements Document), SRS (System Requirements Specifications), the TDD (Technical Design Document) and TRD (Technical Requirements Document) yoking the documentation of those customer needs and wants through the length our software delivery lifecycle? Remember the pain when 'Business' couldn't precisely define which user journeys added most value or how? Our subjective guessing game continued as we finalized those requirements caused us to constantly update those documents - changing line items in the in-scope section of mandatory and nice to have functionality and caught up with the impossible question of trying to forecast how much value we could deliver in the calendar year? It wasn't really so much waterfall as a constant churn that went nowhere. 

Now imagine [DAOs](https://ethereum.org/en/dao/#what-are-daos) (distributed autonomous organizations) premised on a set of universally applicable values express through a protocol, defining objectively with data and analytics where value can be derived for our customers (the community that matters - our tribe). Capital is staked to the products and teams deliver that value - now the team is incentivized to deliver with care and quality - reduce the time and effort to deliver change by emphasizing quality. Imagine acceptance criteria objectively defined in a smart contract that 'defines done' as pre-requisite for passage through the CI/CD pipeline, with the team focused all the while focused on one priority (top of the backlog) delivered with quality before moving to the next. This again is the idea of Yoga (yoking) our work to the needs of our customers, aligned with the market as a whole - serving one without compromising the security of the whole.

Over time, the Turing-completeness of our AI will evolve to the extent that it incrementally better understands, through us and our products; ones that serve customers and evolve to meet their needs without compromising the those of the commons. The key to human-centric AI that dovetails private and public interests is having objective data interpreted by *public* blockchain networks in a relatively decentralized manner (to mitigate bias while making justifiable architectural trade-offs). All the while, costs are borne entirely by those who use the network and not in any sense externalized - that means proof of stake.

To understand the digital tokens secure nodes that verify and validate transactions on proof of stake networks better, ironically, a good starting point is our prehistoric past. Something we explore in the [Part ](https://transition-insight.com/f/the-promise-of-blockchain-and-ai-the-prehistoric-ledger)4 where I riff on the late anthropologist and anarchist David Graeber's take on our prehistoric past. Digital tokens are obviously not material in the physical sense - and we don't need our token to be a tangibly scarce commodity - those including gold are in any case too industrially valuable in a productive sense to use as tokens or hoard as a 'standard'. Similarly, prehistoric communities transacted value without material tokens.
