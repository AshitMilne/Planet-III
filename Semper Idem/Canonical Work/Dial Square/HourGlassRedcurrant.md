**Artwork**: Culture and legacy is distilled as redcurrant. Our glass is the collective value derived from each of us spending time. Our glass fills with wine or brandy (blood) as sand pours through hourglass (in the body). This is the esoteric meaning of the *Eucharist ('Your Christ' consciousness).*

I waited patiently for the Lord He inclined and heard my cry He brought me up out of the pit Out of the miry clay

I will sing, sing a new song I will sing, sing a new song

How long to sing this song? How long to sing this song? How long, how long, how long How long to sing this song?

You set my feet upon a rock And made my footsteps firm Many will see Many will see and fear ~ U2 ([40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMVghDg-ePc))

**Optimism**

Returning to the Square briefly before we turn to the Dial - it symbolizes fairness and a solid foundation upon the miry clay. We speak of a *square meal* or of dealing *squarely*—terms that evoke the expectation of integrity in our dealings with the world. It frames the outer limit of our consciousness, representing openness and transparency, with the implicit belief that fairness is the default state of the universe—balance being the lot of all sentient beings in symbiosis. This requires an honest reckoning with reality, an acceptance of what it entails, free from judgment. It is the spirit of *amor fati*—you get what you get all while posting (creating) with the optimism that comes from *knowing* there is something larger than even the mightest of us: The Universal.

Yet, while the square offers a foundation, it also carries risk. Its openness, in the absence of subsequent layers and without the solidity and certitude offered by the Dial it is left exposed to the capriciousness of civil discourse in discord. In dealings with *humanity* and its fallen aspect we encounter caprice and the Dial is there to set one's feet upon a rock and make our footsteps firm as we navigate this world; while the rest of creation accepts its fate with little complaint giants seek to bend creation to their design. The Stoics sought to evolve humanity beyond the embodiment of humanity's whims in pagan designs, emphasizing virtue, contentment, and the ready acceptance of fate. To live without blaming the gods despite the actions of giants who fashion themselves as kings to play at puppeteering.

In ancient Rome Seneca the Younger—advisor and tutor to Nero—was ordered to take his own life by his former protégé. He met his fate with composure; slitting his wrists, and when that did not work quickly enough, he took poison. Whether or not he was complicit in the assassination plot is beside the point; by taking his own life, he signaled alignment with regime change and alignment with a greater whole as Rome descended into decay.

By then, even those in the highest halls of power were performing *bullshit jobs*—Rome’s elite had become unwitting zombies of death and DECAY*** while Nero squandered Rome’s wealth on lavish spectacles debasing its specie in the process and when money ran low resorted to confiscations from the wealthy to fund breads and circus.

**Sun Salutation**

From the earliest days of civilization, as we developed the ability to generate surplus, we sought ways to preserve and store value—ideally in forms that were durable, relatively immutable, or even appreciating over time. Grain, wine, and its northern cousin, mead, functioned as proto-currencies: stores of value that could be saved, consumed later, or traded for other goods and services. Salt, too—so valuable that it gave rise to the word *salary*—was used to pay Rome’s soldiers. Salt, like brandy, is a product of transformation, a distilled essence of seawater that preserved meat and fish, making them viable for long-distance trade. In this expression of blood, brandy, and salt, I present the Dial Square accordingly.

Which came first—the Square or the Dial? This is an existential question posed within a metaphorical inquiry into human existence. The Square is never without its Dial, nor its Yoga Element (or Lingam). The Dial receives signal from creation—pure, direct, and radiant—while the yoga element represents the inner instrument, the reflective capacity that perceives and measures dissonance in that signal. It is this internal dialogue that minds the gap between truth and beauty.

With each signal, a worldview is shaped—guiding the self toward either **meaning** (affirmation) or **incoherence** (nihilism). Thus, the interplay between external truth and internal resonance becomes the axis on which meaning is turned.

The Square is the constructed mound—formed of [*tels* and *tevs*](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/call-me?blogcategory=Peridot+(Illumination)), layers of habitation and memory in this life and echoed through ages and into the present as an unknowable blend of nurtured nature. The Dial atop tells time with unwavering precision, referencing the sole eternal authority on earth: the sun. Together they make a Dial Square each of which receives its own bespoke measure of this truth, calibrated uniquely to its place and moment in the cosmos. In summary the Dial validates (objective) and verifies (contextual) truth to discern alignment to natural order (beauty) while the Yoga Element uses models (the symbols of language) to discourse with self and other in perpetual dialectic to seek an ultimately unknowable but nevertheless approachable truth. This is what we mean by divine (which mean 'to discover').

Just as the Square (Stone Rose) reverberates with an echo of genetic history so too is it our base of nurtured distilled knowledge. When we value our time through meaningful work, not imposed by institutions or state, our hourglass fills with purpose; through introversion and [attraction](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/attraction?blogcategory=Regnum+Dei+-+1.+Dial+Square) we each discover calling in partnership and community and the edifice of imagined power crumbls in a milne to find flow as sand or salt in a mind embued with anarchy. Our time becomes our own again and we are freed to reimagine our collective sense of value which is then distilled and encapsulated in the Dial (Our Glass).

That philosophy is encoded in our language and may be *read* to inform and sustain our body politic much as as the *red* which flows within informs and sustains the body corporeal. This is why I call Our Glass *Redcurrant*. In modern terms what we are talking about is the definition of philosophical models through which transactional data may flow and be interpreted through the lens of legitimate frameworks (those which have consensus among actual humans rather than fictitious entities) and where outcomes are compared and contrasted to affect ever greater productive ones.

Let's explore this idea by delving into origins of Dial Square's legacy colour - redcurrant and related terms current and currency and the significance of the *route* through which traffic of energy and matter is moved; interecedent points must have the capacity to reconcile valid (i.e. culturally subjective) variances to define a universally valid notional value (price).

I have rendered the Dial Square in redcurrant. The redcurrant represents the distilled spirit of virtue. Brandy, derived from the Dutch *brandewijn* (burned wine), embodies transformation through the purifying power of fire, concentrating and refining wine. This process carries a mythical weight, from the Dionysian rites to the sacred fires of Vedic soma, and even echoes in the Eucharist—the consumption of Christ's blood. It represents the enduring essence of a thing. Wine, of course, comes from grapes—*pukka* (ripe) fruit with firmness (solidity). It grows on a vine, whose roots reach deep into the earth, drawing strength and sustenance from below. Redcurrant was a currency in every sense - used as money - driven through the filter of a collective sense of taste.

All fruit and seeds are reflections of the divine and that is why they are offered as prasad*** in the east. From a system design perspective the Square, as described [earlier ](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/1-square---the-stone?blogcategory=Regnum+Dei+-+1.+Dial+Square)a rudimentary and artificially human consruct is evolved towards the dial with imagination. In nature objects of solidity, mass, compactness and *relative* finality are celestial (suns, their planets, and moons) - aspects of divinity and their movement the cosmic dance of the song celestial (Bhagavad Gita). The Dial Square complete with the ultimately unknowable Yoga Element (Lingam) represents humanity aligned through credibly derived consensus in time approaching divinity (*Deus En Machina*) - and ultimately - the evaporation of Caesar. This is the singularity.

**The Current Jam**

"But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us." — *2 Corinthians 4:7* 

A system designed to permit 'honest' transactions with a universally valid notion of price that is to say ones that permit due consideration between countarparties and that does not compromise holistic integral strength must contend with incumbent systems that are sub-optimal having become reliant on the use of those same compromises to assure continued dominion of a part of that system at the expense of the whole. Let's explore this by going to the root of the word currency - Corinth - related to which is St. Paul’s gospel, as expressed through his exhortations in Corinthians.  Corinth was the conduit through traffic was allowed to flow between a pair of ancient opposites - Sparta and Athens.

Between Sparta and Athens lay 'cosmopolitan' **Corinth** which you can think of as a fulcrum or joint with the tension and potentiality implied by the condition of having to intercede between and reconcile those ancient polarized powers Sparta (in Laconia) and Athens (in Attica).**  While Sparta sang in unison, Athens argued in harmony. Other opposite aspects of their 'personality' are collective/individual, body/mind, discipline/desire, order/chaos, silence/noise, warcraft/statecraft, signal/chaos. In a bi-polar world fraught with tension things and people were cleared and settled through Corinth. It was a place of discord as well discussion of how reconciliation should happen. Corinthians 1:10:

*I appeal to you, brothers and sisters, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree with one another in what you say and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly united in mind and thought.*

Both goods and values were refined in the passage through Corinth. From its name, we inherit not only *currant*—once “raisins of Corinth,” a commodity in motion—but also the very terms *current* and *currency*, derived from the Latin *currens*, meaning “to run.” These imply both movement—wave and particle in motion—and a stillness held within that motion: a moment of denominational determination, in every sense of the term. 

And so the etymological thread is revelatory: what began as dried grapes flowing through Mediterranean markets became metaphors for **flow itself**—of energy, capital, consensus. *Currant* (a good), became *current* (a flow), which evolved into *currency* (a shared agreement on value). These are not just words—they are **evidences of throughput**, of negotiated meaning traveling through systems, reconciled in real time.

Corinth, then, is the ancestor of the [smart contract.](https://transition-insight.com/transition-insight/f/value-equivalency-matrix?blogcategory=Hand+Sum+Models+(Draw+Rings)) Its legacy is not only in coin or grape, but in the logic of intercession—how strangers, cities, or systems come to agree. In ancient times, this agreement was forged through ritual, reputation, and redress. In ours, it is increasingly encoded. **Smart contracts** offer a new Dial Square: a platform calibrated to validate truth, verify terms, and reconcile variances without coercion—provided we still agree on the value being transacted.

In the complexity of civilization agreement between counterparties applies as much to strangers in atomic transaction as it does is in the purely intellectual and philosophical terms applied in relationships with non-monetary considerations (care). These were metropolitans spaces and Corinth was cosmopolitan - wide in its standards of what was deemed acceptable - which insofar as the parties involved are in agreement as to due consideration (always transacted in legal tender) should not concern anyone else. To the degree it does, they cannot be said to be able to conduct a free exchange.That coercion becomes ever more untenable as sovereign's *notion* of value (its token) separates from a reality readily appreciated by ordinary people (value). This is why Corinth became famed not only for its great wealth but also as a place where compromises where created in every sense. Coercion and the appeal to the fascia of one's reputation has always been a node through which the sovereign and the incumbently powerful apply their will - generally to sustain their dominance. The need for holistically credible system design has always been an imperative but never more so today as risks in our modern day context - interplay between countarparts to ancient Sparta and Athens multiply exponentially in a world where demand for materiality has run amok.

The appropriate response to an insane reality is to direct oneself elsewhere; to introversion**** and the discussive impulse of the Yoga Element (Lingum) and its transformative power; through it we rediscover that we are whole and enough - and in fact *have* enough - to navigate in the world of men and even one of giants.

**Alignment to a Natural Order**

Self-similarity is expressed in man, his community, his civilization and his species. The development of our capacity to connect by transcending traditional notions of tribe is leading humanity away from infantile allegiances to memes we once considered sacrosanct such as the nation-state towards self-sovereignty and personal responsibility. 

We're moving at different speeds to the degree allowed by our awarness. Many will see and fear the change - even resist it. Nevertheless it is coming for it must if we are to survive as a species. I've marked this transition for myself by changing how I represent myself to the world. As I continue to restore body and mind by reassessing the rituals and tasks of my day I reconstruct my life as a whole to better align with the natural order. 

Here are Bill Moyers and Joseph Campbell in conversation discussing what is asked of those who embrace their calling:

*Dutifully Executing Conventional Activities Yieldlessly

**One lay in Laconia (hence laconic) and one Attica (hence Atticus who provides the defense in Harper Lee's *To Kill A Mockingbird*). [Sparta Prague](https://sparta.cz/en)   in a city of coldwar thresholds—between East and West, myth and modernity adopted redcurrant as its livery in 1906 inspired by Arsenal (Dial Square) in a time of kings, kaisers and czars as though foretelling a modern cold-war replaying of that ancient hellenic one.

***Prasāda (Sanskrit: प्रसाद), also known as *prasad* or *prasadam*, is a sacred offering in Hinduism and Sikhism. It typically refers to fruit or nuts (including ground nuts) that have been offered to a deity during worship and is then distributed to devotees as a blessed gift. The term derives from the Sanskrit root *prasād*, meaning "grace" or "favour," signifying the deity's blessing bestowed upon the offering. 

****I prefer this term (or alternatively introspection) to 'prayer' because it implies that the unknowable divine is within and that one is seeking to know *calling and path* rather than ask for gifts (which in all truth have already been granted).
