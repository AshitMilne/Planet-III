## Introduction ##

If Anima is the innately rational yet *connected* aspect of intelligence regardless of linguistic convention, i.e the anarchic intelligence    emanated in Creation (the ecology), then we approach the 'other' as uniquely embodied identity, in plain language, a person (not a role, responsibility or title). Previously we noted that Creation expresses masculine and feminine *aspects* distinct from notions of gender or sex in all life. As humans we, compete, explore, press into adventures. However we also nurture, hold, mentor, encourage, long to be at home. These are not mutually exclusive traits nor are they paradoxes. We hold these seemingly contradictory aspects just as we in turn exhale and inhale to seek balance. We each have bespoke ratios of these traits and we imagine that we may guide each other to express our two aspects in perfect balance as a species, as a whole.

This piece aims to reconcile notions of competition with anima that *exclude* animus - hostility and defensiveness (i.e. envy or vindictiveness). In our pastimes and games  we set forth rules and boundaries that define the parameters for legitimate behaviour (truth). Invariably it's when we emphasize the end result that beauty is removed from the spectacle.

Any exploration of prehistoric reality is conjecture but we remain unchanged in a foundational sense for 50,000 to 100,000 years. The close-knit communities of our distance past were naturally inclined to expressing anima both at home, by the hearth as well as away in the wilderness - collaborating to scale their tribe. Animus was the impulse of the challenge - an exception to the rule when surviving at any cost became an imperative: a tribes introspection through internal dialogue having concluded keeping the tribe 'whole' precluded discovery of *equivalence* with the 'other'. In a sense a tribes capital had been completely depleted and its balance (or equilibrium) hacked.

## Power Law ##

Meritocratic and reflexive self-repeating expression of Pareto. The one out of 8 billion on earth is a mark responsible for 4% of global productivity how and why it is irrelevant (until it is - i.e. expressed by *how* capital is applied)

 

Virtualis is Latin for virtue and bears no relationship to the term we use for the synthetic representation of reality - virtual. Nevertheless there is a compelling synchronicity in the context of the virtual machine (VM) - the completion of architecture that promises to complete the utility of modern capitalism. The VM promises to the scale the virtue of the wild nobility through nodality made credible by that simple and powerful quality; an insurmountable *defensive* array that renders offense obsolete when expressed by those with virtue: *transparency.*

*Banter weight - punch above any weight - royal (rhetoric, propaganda, mind game virtualis = meme)

What is society - and what makes it a ‘political economy’? Today value is increasingly exchanged online in a complex and opaque ‘unfinished architecture’ that struggles to authenticate and measure peoples’ identity and therefore, critically the degree to which we can *trust* them making the web a vast opportunity for those with a predatory instinct - socially and economically. We have centralized transactional power (i.e. the ability to move data - and that includes money which is just a type of data - a ledger entry) to large private institutions who have amassed enormous wealth through surveillance that monitors, manipulates and then [monetize](https://deloitte.wsj.com/cio/the-dangers-of-monetizing-data-1435636906)s our economic and [social](https://www.wsj.com/tech/meta-facebook-instagram-pedophiles-enforcement-struggles-dceb3548) behaviour; or who in the case of Apple use a secure closed platform to extract a massive tribute from creators who have no alternative but to comply with the terms 'offered'. The irony is that even as we struggle to protect ourselves against them, they themselves face the challenge of governing hundreds of thousands of globally distributed employees and securing their own domains - a situation amplified by [geo-political adversarialism](https://www.wsj.com/articles/cybersecurity-risk-rose-in-past-year-say-compliance-professionals-64ad4223?mod=Searchresults_pos5&page=1). Unintended consequences are to be grappled with. They have centralizing tendencies that have created destabilising income and wealth inequality within nation states and between them.

The modern tendency to centralize economic and monetary exchange, send it through limited nodes and through ever fewer routes is grounded in a ‘conventional’ or classical school of economics that came out of a 20th century enraptured by science in an era animated by the power unleashed by Oppenheimer and Einstein - even our cars aped rocket ships mid-century. In a fit of ‘science-envy’ Economists were compensating - they ruptured from the humanities definitively to their own pseudo-scientific mark on the planet’s industry and culture. And what we appear to have done as a result is manifest a world in which to quote the Stereophonics *“we're going wrong, we've all become the same, we dress the same ways, only our accents change”.* Travelling the same highways, watching the same shows on the same five streaming channels, all driving down the same 16-lane highway at the same time, living our technology-enabled lives in a handful of large companies singing ‘we’ve got the whole world in our hands.’

Whatever their value - and there’s no denial here that they have their place -  to model economics ‘scientifically’ enormous assumptions are made  - the primary one being that people are hyper-rational actors with complete agency, who are free of bias, unemotional and capable of always acting in their self-interest without manipulation *and that the aggregate outcome is positive for the commons*. More multidisciplinary approaches have since put the ‘social’ back into the (dismal) science. We briefly touched on them earlier with reference to Kahneman and to Thaler’s ideas on libertarian paternalism. I’ll summarize their approaches by simply saying that emotions - kinship and intimacy engendered by the comfort, safety and trust created in an environment that is at once transparent yet private are meaningful. The technological enablement of an environments that gauges community (tribes) rationally is [coming](https://zkp.science/).

Paradoxically these solutions allow us to  scale an architecture from our ancient past - when debt and credit were held in a constant equilibrium by the natural give and take of humans simply being without fungible tokens being exchanged for the valuable. I’m no palaeontologist or anthropologist and the wide and various distribution of human experience and the chronological distance, in any case precludes a truly a scientific discussion - that is both beyond my bailiwick and purpose here: To explain that value does not require the exchange of a tangible, material, physical token - it does not need to be anchored to gold and silver and that true value beyond the tangible earth upon which we stand derives from behaviour manifested in our personalities -  and curiously, Richard Thaler’s last name shares its [etymolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Thaler)gy with the word 'dollar'

In Debt: The First 5,000 Years, David Graeber, the late anarchist anthropologist imagined our prehistoric ancestors wandering in small groups - well under the 150-odd with whom we can maintain a meaningful relationship. In these small, closely-knit communities we kept an approximate mental tally of who did what - there was obviously no barter - the lack of a coincidence of wants prevented that and in any case transactions weren’t one-off in a community that gave and received one from the other in a perpetual cycle of value exchange unencumbered by loose change or bills or any such token. It was all debt. To one another we constantly thought the refrain ‘I’m in your debt’. It was crypto (or rather *cryptic*) in the sense of being ambiguous - at once both hidden in obscurity (in minds and hearts) and yet obvious (manifested in our relationships, expressed in physical and psychological proximity, to one another). An unseen web of ‘exchange’ tied us together. And as Graeber had it, if you didn’t pick up your end, you might (not) wake up one morning and notice everyone else had left - a rock on your head.

No precise quota to hit daily of berries, mammoths or children minded was applied, obviously, and our contribution to the ‘gathering’ may only have been a knack for story-telling or an innate shamanistic quality that was as hard to fathom, explain or quantify. [Bran Stark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bran_Stark) was worth the ‘carry cost’.

Each gave as their inimitable attributes allowed and received as they required. The most immediately resonant modern version of this is the Israeli [kibbutzim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kibbutz). In the very earliest days there was little surplus, but over time we developed a collective intellectual capital of ‘know how’ that passed between us and from which, over time, we developed comfort from discomfort in a perpetually collaborative endeavour in which we were out to score ever higher personal bests’.

**Kings of the Wild Frontier**

Physical strength, power and endurance and tactical skill with sabretooth tigers isn’t equally distributed and P[areto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution) implies that generally a small subset of natural leaders accounted for assuring the majority of *security* needs and managing existential risk - a record of behaviour reflecting trustworthiness, integrity and fairness imbued a quality of early noblesse oblige for these paternalistic authoritarians. But leadership at the base layer was always subjected to close scrutiny and *dynamically meritocratic* - circumstances demanded it and there was too much at stake. Contenders for leadership would have appeared but the merit of their challenge was subject to the collective's transparent observations and at the same time, proteges watched and learned - *all,* regardless of age demanded that objective real collective benefit was actualized by leaders - they had a continual need to prove their stake. Those with social credit in the group aligned and those with emergent (say, the young) or otherwise non-material credit (the dim but strong or kind perhaps) followed. Those without any credit are the ones who woke up to find everyone gone, got rocked (*slashed*).

Nothing that constituted the art and science of leadership was hoarded - leaders with social credit were expected to share information freely to enable collective security now and into the future. In these small closely knit communities  an easy give and take allowed productivity to grow on a bedrock of collective security. These 'Kings of the Wild Frontier' were adamant about one thing - the self-preservation and security of their own tribe; in circumstances that did not permit utter transparency - an encounter with complete strangers - they were *never* 'defence first' - diplomacy and collaborative collectivism was not top of mind. Xenophobia, whether we care to admit it was once (and in certain circumstances still is) a feature and not a bug. While it wasn't a 'defence first' the posture may reasonably called a 'robust bias towards self-defence necessitated by ambiguous circumstances' (or 'shoot first, ask questions later'). There were variances of course, and at times it was just kill or enslave their foes and take everything (the Māori* arriving on Pitcairn as Jared Diamond relates)

Over time the yield to the collectives that survived (those that 'adapted to strangers well') was manifested as more time and less pain - longer healthier happy lives - not the pursuit but the instant manifestation of happiness. This was a dynamic state of affairs - where behaviour was transparent to all - consensus on governance was created through a *democratic* sorting mechanism that weighted credibility based on transparent observation by all. [In Guns, Germs, And Stee](https://www.amazon.ca/Guns-Germs-Steel-Fates-Societies/dp/0393354326/ref=sr_1_1?sr=8-1)l, Jared Diamond explains:

Band organization is often described as "egalitarian": there is no formalized social stratification into upper and lower classes, no formalized or hereditary leadership, and no formalized monopolies of information and decision making. However, the term "egalitarian" should not be taken to mean that all band members are equal in prestige and contribute equally to decisions. *Rather the term merely means that any band "leadership" is informal and acquired through qualities such as personality, strength, intelligence, and fighting skills*." (italics my own).

**Back to the Future**

How does this relate to Proof of Stake blockchain? Blockchains create an immutable chain that constitutes consensus on what is true and has value on the network. This chain is created through a process similar to the sorting described above minus the 'xenophobia' (bias) as it operates in a *transparent* ecosystem verifying and validates transactions neutrally for value - the passing of information between parties. Its peers on the network assess and join chains until a consensus forms on the network on transactions to be immutably confirmed on the blockchain. Bad behaviour, such as obvious front-running driven by arbitrary extraction of value gets penalized (the term is actually 'slashed').

In Graeber's gathering or in any community (or say kibbutzim - a modern equivalent) that data was the know-how required to survive and hopefully, eventually thrive and it's rooted in a sense of what objectively works and comes from people with skill, experience and virtue that bestows legitimacy. They are nodes that secure the network - their tribe - and data of the highest most meaningful value is passed through them. Their reward is first and foremost a thriving community, a sense of purpose and prestige.

Participants in Proof of Stake protocols - particularly those who have taken the material risk of building and securing the network as nodes are driven by that same sense of purpose - aligning private and public interests in an information technology network that is transparent and doesn't require permission from arbitrarily imposed authority on, nor is censored by it although they are rewarded for the basic 'sacrifice' of present consumption in exchange of future consumption staking their tokens. In a sense, this is a modern, decentralized, pluralist yet collectivist analogue of the bond-wielding patriotism of the great twentieth century wars.

The network secures privacy through encryption for the involved parties - but not anonymity. The anonymous - those that are faceless in any context, pre-historic or modern, have no place in a secure community (global or otherwise) - not in the context of money at least. Money is power and demands governance and oversight.

*An veneration of ancient Maori temperament remains in sport - the modern proxy for conflict - the All Blacks' [Haka](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yiKFYTFJ_kw). There's no method to the 'madness' of their wild nobility, just a pride about their manner - they mean to subjugate their foe.
