## The Vision ##
Imagine a real-time, on-chain version of Palantir Foundry—without centralized orchestration—where trusted identities transact freely across community, corporate, and sovereign boundaries. Here, data flows without censorship, governed transparently by rules that align individual self-interest with the commons. We call this Intelligent Capital: sound information (like good money) moving at the speed of light. It may not be immediately obvious but this is the stuff that twentieth-century anarchist dreams were made of. It paves the way to reimagining civil and economic governance by fully integrating good-faith pluralism and opportunism into our global reality.

##  Canon ##
Canonical frameworks are explained are explained in a set of four series which explore core concepts:

- **Sine Qua Non**: What constitutes intelligence, how does one model it to determine priorities in a human-centric system
- **E Pluribus Unum**:  What constitutes a token denoting value in an intelligent system
- **Dial Square**: What are the components that make allow a semantic perimeter that embodies identity (semper idem)
- **InHabit**: How do express behaviour by an identity to develop a view of transactional flow (dhara) to illuminate (diya) opportunities to incrementally enhance intelligence and live with with vision (drishti)
