# The Vision #
Imagine a real-time, on-chain version of Palantir Foundry—without centralized orchestration—where trusted identities transact freely across community, corporate, and sovereign boundaries. Here, data flows without censorship, governed transparently by rules that align individual self-interest with the commons. We call this Intelligent Capital: sound information (like good money) moving at the speed of light. It may not be immediately obvious but this is the stuff that twentieth-century anarchist dreams were made of. It paves the way to reimagining civil and economic governance by fully integrating good-faith pluralism and opportunism into our global reality.

##  Canon ##
Canonical frameworks are explained are explained in a set of four series which explore core concepts:

- **Sine Qua Non**: What constitutes intelligence, how does one model it to determine priorities in a human-centric system
- **E Pluribus Unum**:  What constitutes a token denoting value in an intelligent system
- **Dial Square**: What are the components that make allow a semantic perimeter that embodies identity (semper idem). It is comprised of three components
  - <u>Stone Rose</u>: an assembled identity stack (tal/tel/tev) of attributes, behaviours, habits and attitudes
  - <u>Hourglass of Redcurrant</u>: a process for distilling principles that govern optimal identity expression
  - <u>Yoga Element</u>: the principle that contentment (sufficient joy and satisfaction) occur when the self is aligned to community (Commons) and ecology (Creation)

- **InHabit**: How trend develops in the expression of behaviour by an identity as transactional flow (*dhara*). This may be illuminated (*diya*) to incrementally enhance intelligence and live with vision (*drishti*)

## Peridot ##
A set of documents inquiring into key terms relevant to political-economy and governance in general as viewed through an anarchist lens

## Lexica ##
Lexica defines or describes key terms. These are idiosyncratic to Canon as well as broadly used terms in the social and the applied science of information technology, particularly proof of stake blockchain

## Daily Planet ##

The greater the number of angles we can approach a subject the more sophisticated the holistic lens that is developed to explore language and define a philosophical model that serves humanity in pluralistic ways that are objectively legitimate. Daily Planet provides a background into the experiences that define my  own personal worldview.

## Polite Bureau ##

Aims to provide opinion and editorial perspective from an anarchist lens. Namely it looks at often sub-optimal policy outcomes of 'split the difference' electoral systems even as the system itself is examined to apply regeneration through reductive approaches to code (law) through the application of smart contracts which having a broader insight into transactional data may define preferable outcomes.

## Tout Sweet ##

A casually assembled and far from comprehensive collection of habits, utilities, tools and practices that hint at the underlying philosophy of anarchy (and related minimalist, organic and reductive approaches to life swapping apparent comfort for agency through resistance training that acclimatizes the individual to *natural* order reducing loss aversion and a more objective framing of 'risk'. Energy is redirected from incumbent modes and swapped for agency and time (and capital accrual to all *stakeholders*)
