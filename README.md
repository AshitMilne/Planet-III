# The Vision #
Imagine a real-time, on-chain version of Palantir Foundry—without centralized orchestration—where trusted identities transact freely across community, corporate, and sovereign boundaries. Here, data flows without censorship, governed transparently by rules that align individual self-interest with the commons. We call this Intelligent Capital: sound information (like good money) moving at the speed of light. It may not be immediately obvious but this is the stuff that twentieth-century anarchist dreams were made of. It paves the way to reimagining civil and economic governance by fully integrating good-faith pluralism and opportunism into our global reality.



##  Regnum Dei
A rule (both in terms of governance and measurement which has numerical consensus having been verified in diversity, equity and inclusion by the removing the power and influence of hegemony over time (so-called democratic government). Canonical frameworks for consensus governance are explained in a set of four myth-models which explore core concepts:

### Sine Qua Non (Intelligence)

Through *Sine Qua Non* Parts 1–5, intelligence emerges as the organizing principle of legitimacy, flourishing, and coherence: it is holistic, systemically valid, and expressed through Anima’s five dimensions—connection, empathy, shared time, memory, and shared purpose. From Deus to Virtualis, we see that true intelligence reconciles self, society, and creation, operates without coercion, embodies sufficiency, and catalyzes emergent, harmonious order akin to nature itself. Legitimacy arises not from force or accumulation but from ordination, consensus, creative surplus, and transparent structures that bind communities into coherent wholes. This trajectory naturally pivots to capital: just as intelligence-as-Anima orders life, capital must reflect legitimacy—structured to honor shared purpose, accountability, and long-term sustainability. Misaligned money mirrors misapplied intelligence: clever but destructive. When guided by intelligence, capital becomes a codified, trust-based, and generative expression of human creativity, bounded yet capable of infinite productive potential, transforming individual labor and communal resourcefulness into tangible, life-affirming abundance.

### E Pluribus Unum (Capital)

If Sine Qua Non constitutes legitimate intelligence (without which there is no thingness) then E Pluribus is the lifeblood that flows to make intelligence legitimate in civilization. What constitutes a token denoting value in an intelligent system? It must model *relative* scarcity as it seeks both velocity and equilibrium of *flow* in a system of interactions (transactions); as well it must model true yield (productivity) and have the capacity to make distinctions between growth for its own sake and that towards meaningful aggregate benefit. In practical terms it constitutes legitimate denominators in which jurisdictions may flourish (attract talent and sound capital without hindrance)

### Dial Square (Identity)

The sundial is rendered a unique signal in time and space with which to work reality and manufacture comfort to an subjective but legitimate degree. Three components embody an identity. An instance of an object of type Dial Square is  called a *Semper Idem* (semantic perimeter of identity embodied) or in common parlance, an abstracted identity:

- <u>Stone Rose</u>: an assembled identity stack or mound (tal/tel/tev) of attributes, behaviours, habits and attitudes which are interlock to express conscious flowering of personality, as well as creative expression. 

- <u>Hourglass of Redcurrant</u>: a process for distilling principles that govern optimal identity expression. Intellectual (creative) output is ultimately intellectual capital which is ultimately a common good.

- <u>Yoga Element</u>: the principle that contentment (sufficient joy and satisfaction) occur when the self is aligned to community (Commons) and ecology (Creation)

### InTev (Growth & Productivity)

Pronounced cockney as 'intel' (dropped 'l'): How trend develops in the expression of behaviour by an identity as transactional flow (Dhara). This may be illuminated (Diya) to incrementally enhance intelligence and live with vision (Drishti). Habits (tevs) are internalized and stacked (as tells) when possessed of intelligence (intel).



## Peridot
A series that examines and aims to illuminate key terms relevant to this corpus through the lens of my own experiences: fundamental ideas in governance, system design, political economy, history and culture. Peridot, my birthstone (August), is famous for possessing an internally luminous quality. Historiography is a study within the field of history that examines how history itself is written — the methods, perspectives, sources, and interpretive frameworks historians use, as well as how these have changed over time. I lean into this idea by absorbing into my analysis my own personal life experience unapologetically making it all the more imperative that credibility be self-evident through a different but relatable perspective from one's own.

## Daily Planet

The greater the number of angles we can approach a subject the more sophisticated the holistic lens that is developed to explore language and define a philosophical model that serves humanity in pluralistic ways that are objectively legitimate. Daily Planet provides a background into the Jackanori personal stories or experiences that define my  own personal worldview that become a *form* of knowledge on a virtual plane or dimension.

## Polite Bureau

Aims to provide opinion and editorial perspective from my anarchist lens. It examine at often sub-optimal policy outcomes of 'split the difference' electoral systems even as the system itself is examined to apply regeneration through reductive approaches to code (law) through the application of smart contracts which having a broader insight into transactional data may define preferable outcomes.

## Imprimatur

A casually assembled and far from comprehensive collection of habits, utilities, tools and practices that hint at the underlying philosophy of anarchy (and related minimalist, organic and reductive approaches to life; swapping apparent comfort for agency through resistance training that acclimatizes the individual to *natural* order. Loss aversion is reduced and a more objective common sense approach to framing 'risk' that acknowledges the value of *being* understanding that it is a temporary state. Energy is redirected from incumbent modes and swapped for agency and time. The benefit is reflexive as the capital and effort required to secure 'property' of all kind is released to become a generative asset.

## Lexica

Lexica defines or describes key terms. Some of these are idiosyncratic to Regnum Dei which tries to introduce the power of story-telling and narrative (Jackanori) to cultivate interest in esoteric subject matter without substantially impacting integrity. This is viable in the social sciences (and the application of the social sciences to model systems architecture - broadly political science as it pertains to the *applied* sciences in information technology). As well as broadly used terms in the social and the applied science of information technology, particularly proof of stake blockchain are reintroduced. Some of these are 'heuristics for social science' - subjective narrative story telling that evolves like a Platonic worldview to a Copernican one - both functionally useful but the latter, built on new information, more truthful. This is the stuff of archetype, legend and dreamscapes.
