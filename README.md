# The Vision #
Imagine a real-time, on-chain version of Palantir Foundry—without centralized orchestration—where trusted identities transact freely across community, corporate, and sovereign boundaries. Here, data flows without censorship, governed transparently by rules that align individual self-interest with the commons. We call this Intelligent Capital: sound information (like good money) moving at the speed of light. It may not be immediately obvious but this is the stuff that twentieth-century anarchist dreams were made of. It paves the way to reimagining civil and economic governance by fully integrating good-faith pluralism and opportunism into our global reality.

##  Regnum Dei ##
Canonical frameworks for consensus governance are explained are explained in a set of four myth-models which explore core concepts:

- **Sine Qua Non**: What constitutes intelligence and in particular how do we supplement algorithmic (i.e. objective) logic with system of live intelligence (anima) without bias (animus). How does one model these ideas to determine priorities in a human-centric system for transactional activity.
- **E Pluribus Unum**:  What constitutes a token denoting value in an intelligent system
- **Dial Square**: The sundial is rendered a unique signal in time and space with which to work reality and manufacture comfort to an subjective but legitimate degree. Three components embody an identity. An instance of an object of type Dial Square is  called a *Semper Idem* (semantic perimeter of identity embodied) or in common parlance, an abstracted identity:
  - <u>Stone Rose</u>: an assembled identity stack or mound (tal/tel/tev) of attributes, behaviours, habits and attitudes which are interlock to express conscious flowering of personality, as well as creative expression. 
  - <u>Hourglass of Redcurrant</u>: a process for distilling principles that govern optimal identity expression. Intellectual (creative) output is ultimately intellectual capital which is ultimately a common good.
  - <u>Yoga Element</u>: the principle that contentment (sufficient joy and satisfaction) occur when the self is aligned to community (Commons) and ecology (Creation)
  - <u>InTev</u> (pronounced intel): How trend develops in the expression of behaviour by an identity as transactional flow (*dhara*). This may be illuminated (*diya*) to incrementally enhance intelligence and live with vision (*drishti*). Habits (tevs) are internalized and stacked (as tells) when possessed of intelligence (intel).

A series inquiring into key terms relevant to political-economy and governance in general as viewed through an anarchist lens

Lexica defines or describes key terms. These are idiosyncratic to Canon as well as broadly used terms in the social and the applied science of information technology, particularly proof of stake blockchain

## Daily Planet ##

The greater the number of angles we can approach a subject the more sophisticated the holistic lens that is developed to explore language and define a philosophical model that serves humanity in pluralistic ways that are objectively legitimate. Daily Planet provides a background into the experiences that define my  own personal worldview.

## Polite Bureau ##

Aims to provide opinion and editorial perspective from an anarchist lens. Namely it looks at often sub-optimal policy outcomes of 'split the difference' electoral systems even as the system itself is examined to apply regeneration through reductive approaches to code (law) through the application of smart contracts which having a broader insight into transactional data may define preferable outcomes.

## Tout Sweet ##

A casually assembled and far from comprehensive collection of habits, utilities, tools and practices that hint at the underlying philosophy of anarchy (and related minimalist, organic and reductive approaches to life; swapping apparent comfort for agency through resistance training that acclimatizes the individual to *natural* order. Loss aversion is reduced and a more objective common sense approach to framing 'risk' that acknowledges the value of *being* understanding that it is a temporary state. Energy is redirected from incumbent modes and swapped for agency and time. The benefit is reflexive as the capital and effort required to secure 'property' of all kind is released to become a generative asset.
